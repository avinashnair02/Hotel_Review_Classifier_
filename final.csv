Courtyard Bengaluru Outer Ring Road,A Staycation to fondly remember for a long time!,"We went to Courtyard Marriott ORR Bengaluru for our staycation as break from stay at home covid routine to going to a hotel and just relax and enjoy the experience. The offer made by the hotel was excellent. I did the booking of 2 rooms and landed up at the hotel on the designated date and time.  The first person to meet us was Priyanka Rawat at front desk, She was very conscious of the covid protocol and helped us get our paper work done while ensuring social distancing from other guests. She was very polite and took care of our stay through out. Post check in we were taken to our upgraded rooms. We never felt uncomfortable as the rooms and very nook and corner seemed to be cleaned very well. The hotel staff is excellent and took care of our every need. Few names to remember", fondly are Sumit in Restaurant who was very well aware of all the preferences and made sure we get best and personalized experience. Dheeraj at breakfast time was like Jarvis in iron man (Every need fulfilled ASAP). Kailash did bring up our wine knowledge few notches while we were in wine tasting session. And a big shout out to Chef Sajid Patel and Lalit in his team who specially made continental fish for me and family during dinner buffet which was heavenly.  Me and my family wished we could have stayed more than 3 days and continue enjoying the signature Marriott hospitality little more but workday calls for you to go back to grind. An experience to fondly remember. Thanks to all behind the scene staff of the hotel for making it happen.,5.0,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>"

Sheraton Grand Bangalore Hotel at Brigade Gateway,Sheraton's Secret Ingredient - Debalina,"In an excellent location just downtown Bangalore and diagonally resting near Orion, WorldTrade Centre and Iskon Temple, this is an excellent facility. Rooms are excellent, clean and well decorated. The reception is nice, welcoming and efficiently run special shout out to Suraj and Hari from the front-desk team.  Good review so far and wondering why still a 4 star? ""Food=Disappointment"" not Sheraton Standards, I booked my staycation for 2nights and after tasting the food, I had to cut-short my stay and move to another hotel. Like the saying ""Good Food Good Mood"" - My mood was spoiled after having the food at the restaurant ""Feast"" and yeah had to cheer myself up by stepping out of the hotel for a while. I mean, who can mess up a DOSA, I have attached a photo of the Dosa that was"," served to me and for a moment, it made me think where did I step in. But yes, it's just not about the Dosa, but the entire Breakfast and Lunch was a disaster I would say.  But what made the difference is the attention I got specifically with the help from Debalina in the front-office department who made my stay even better by listening to my concern and addressing it on priority during her busy hours and promising for a room upgrade on my next visit. Her commitment to guest satisfaction is highly commendable. I am glad I met her. Sweet surprise meeting Pradeep - Head of HR during my check-out and him asking about my experience during my stay is highly appreciated.   Overall, this place has got knowledgeable staff with low ego and great service. Service that reminds me Kudos to Priya and Gurmeet from the F&B service team for being very accommodating and making me feel at home. All in all, I would highly recommend a stay here both for business and leisure travellers.

See you all soon.," bottom and was smelly, and also the slippers were unpacked which is for sure not the case in any 5 start hotels at least the ones that I have been to. on a side not, the membership was never mentioned or thanked for being member which is fine, but its pretty standard for Marriott to do that in any hotels you go. So overall I wouldn't stay at this hotel again for sure.

The Ritz-Carlton,Memorable social event at Fire pit 😊,"As an InterNations Ambassador I host official social events every month. This time I decided to do it at Ritz Carlton.  I called up customer care, they connect me to PR and spoke to Upasna and later she connected me with FnB Director Malvika. In no time venue was suggested and confirmation email was sent. What an excellent followup and teamwork. As I booked the venue, more than a month in advance,  Malvika ensured to follow up again a week before the event. And later on the day of event Upasana and Malvika came to meet in person. No wonder why Ritz Carlton has such a great reputation because of their wonderful and committed staff like Malvika and Upasana. Hats off to you guys.  The event went very well. All the guests had good time. Vishvesh and his team did a good job. I can"," recall Akash as I interacted him more.  Thank you guys for what you do to create amazing experiences for the guests.  Hope to host more more events in future   Best, Hritika Bhagat  Ambassador-InterNations Bengaluru Community  ",4.5,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>"

The Ritz-Carlton,Memorable social event at Fire pit 😊,"As an InterNations Ambassador I host official social events every month. This time I decided to do it at Ritz Carlton.  I called up customer care, they connect me to PR and spoke to Upasna and later she connected me with FnB Director Malvika. In no time venue was suggested and confirmation email was sent. What an excellent followup and teamwork. As I booked the venue, more than a month in advance,  Malvika ensured to follow up again a week before the event. And later on the day of event Upasana and Malvika came to meet in person. No wonder why Ritz Carlton has such a great reputation because of their wonderful and committed staff like Malvika and Upasana. Hats off to you guys.  The event went very well. All the guests had good time. Vishvesh and his team did a good job. I can"," recall Akash as I interacted him more.  Thank you guys for what you do to create amazing experiences for the guests.  Hope to host more more events in future   Best, Hritika Bhagat  Ambassador-InterNations Bengaluru Community  ",4.5,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>"
Courtyard Bengaluru Outer Ring Road,A Staycation to fondly remember for a long time!,"We went to Courtyard Marriott ORR Bengaluru for our staycation as break from stay at home covid routine to going to a hotel and just relax and enjoy the experience. The offer made by the hotel was excellent. I did the booking of 2 rooms and landed up at the hotel on the designated date and time.  The first person to meet us was Priyanka Rawat at front desk, She was very conscious of the covid protocol and helped us get our paper work done while ensuring social distancing from other guests. She was very polite and took care of our stay through out. Post check in we were taken to our upgraded rooms. We never felt uncomfortable as the rooms and very nook and corner seemed to be cleaned very well. The hotel staff is excellent and took care of our every need. Few names to remember", fondly are Sumit in Restaurant who was very well aware of all the preferences and made sure we get best and personalized experience. Dheeraj at breakfast time was like Jarvis in iron man (Every need fulfilled ASAP). Kailash did bring up our wine knowledge few notches while we were in wine tasting session. And a big shout out to Chef Sajid Patel and Lalit in his team who specially made continental fish for me and family during dinner buffet which was heavenly.  Me and my family wished we could have stayed more than 3 days and continue enjoying the signature Marriott hospitality little more but workday calls for you to go back to grind. An experience to fondly remember.

Sheraton Grand Bangalore Hotel at Brigade Gateway,Sheraton's Secret Ingredient - Debalina,"In an excellent location just downtown Bangalore and diagonally resting near Orion, WorldTrade Centre and Iskon Temple, this is an excellent facility. Rooms are excellent, clean and well decorated. The reception is nice, welcoming and efficiently run special shout out to Suraj and Hari from the front-desk team.  Good review so far and wondering why still a 4 star? ""Food=Disappointment"" not Sheraton Standards, I booked my staycation for 2nights and after tasting the food, I had to cut-short my stay and move to another hotel. Like the saying ""Good Food Good Mood"" - My mood was spoiled after having the food at the restaurant ""Feast"" and yeah had to cheer myself up by stepping out of the hotel for a while. I mean, who can mess up a DOSA, I have attached a photo of the Dosa that was"," served to me and for a moment, it made me think where did I step in. But yes, it's just not about the Dosa, but the entire Breakfast and Lunch was a disaster I would say.  But what made the difference is the attention I got specifically with the help from Debalina in the front-office department who made my stay even better by listening to my concern and addressing it on priority during her busy hours and promising for a room upgrade on my next visit. Her commitment to guest satisfaction is highly commendable. I am glad I met her.

The Ritz-Carlton,Memorable social event at Fire pit 😊,"As an InterNations Ambassador I host official social events every month. This time I decided to do it at Ritz Carlton.  I called up customer care, they connect me to PR and spoke to Upasna and later she connected me with FnB Director Malvika. In no time venue was suggested and confirmation email was sent. What an excellent followup and teamwork. As I booked the venue, more than a month in advance,  Malvika ensured to follow up again a week before the event. And later on the day of event Upasana and Malvika came to meet in person. No wonder why Ritz Carlton has such a great reputation because of their wonderful and committed staff like Malvika and Upasana. Hats off to you guys.  The event went very well. All the guests had good time. Vishvesh and his team did a good job. I can"," recall Akash as I interacted him more.  Thank you guys for what you do to create amazing experiences for the guests.  Hope to host more more events in future   Best, Hritika Bhagat  Ambassador-InterNations Bengaluru Community  ",4.5,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>","<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_45""></span>"

See you all soon.," bottom and was smelly, and also the slippers were unpacked which is for sure not the case in any 5 start hotels at least the ones that I have been to. on a side not, the membership was never mentioned or thanked for being member which is fine, but its pretty standard for Marriott to do that in any hotels you go. So overall I wouldn't stay at this hotel again for sure.

Fahaad, the HK manager invited me to do a 4 hours workshop at the BG's restaurant on the occasion of Holi. Fahaad made sure to arrange everything I need to conduct a successful event.

My kids left a mess on the table and he was very kind and told us not to worry and he LL look after it for us.

Sheraton Grand Bangalore Hotel at Brigade Gateway,Wintering in the Sheraton Grand in Bamgalore in 2020,"First off: Being a Titanium Elite member it was a little sad the way the lack of a lounge, due to Covid, was handled.  Members want a quiet place to go to (even during room cleaning) and the Lobby/Bar is no substitute.  However, The Hotel:  The hotel is situated in the World Trade Center complex which includes a Major Mall.  The security here is at a very high standard.
