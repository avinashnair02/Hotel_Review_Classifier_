"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Grand Chola is the worst ever in every way,1,"Hi,  My name is Vijay Jung Thapa - and I stayed at the ITC Grand Chola for three nights March 21 to 23, 2021.  I’m not someone who usually writes reviews and the occasional bad experience I take in my stride, believing the staff and the hotel are having a bad day - and we all occasionally have one.

Taj Club House,Embarrassing,1,"My friend(Who was staying with me)’s brother had come in the night to see us in the night and we requested to send to the room saying that he’ll leave in 15 minutes but the staff and the duty manager had an arrogant tone which was so unlike any other Taj properties. We understand there are certain rules but you can’t look down on your regular customers. We are telling we are ready to provide id of the guest but the reply was “ nobody is allowed after 9pm”. A reputed hotel known for the hospitality felt like a jail, the duty manager speaks like you don’t deserve to stay here and was so unapologetic and entitled. We don’t pay such a big amount to feel unwelcomed. It’s like front desk staff aren’t payed for months hence they’re not interested in their jobs . Please be aware that…"

After a day's stay we still requested for connecting rooms but was not taken into consideration after we came back there a further 6 days from the tour. We also requested for a premium room where the whole family can be together topping up extra but that too was ignored.The manager was full of excuses and we were given a second floor with no wash taps for the toilets at all.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,The Radisson Group are the result of this very poor review!!!,1,"Like many other guests of Radisson Blu Chennai, this is best considered as an airport-accessible hotel rather than a city centre hotel. As such it is fine but probably not worth the room rate available.

Out biggest problem with the Radisson group is that the central reservation service just does not work! We wanted to discuss a change to our original booking and we had plenty of time before the cancellation date but the Reservation system either did not reply or sent auto reply messages saying they would consider the matter!

As such it is fine but probably not worth the room rate available. The reason for this conclusions is that the rooms, whilst close to the airport, are still not that much more accessible than those on the south (?) side of the city. Out biggest problem with the Radisson group is that the central reservation service just does not work! We wanted to discuss a change to our original booking and we had plenty of time before the cancellation date but the Reservation system either did not reply or sent auto reply messages saying they would consider the matter!

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Random booking efficiency....,1, Yes it is really narrow from the airport but Quite risky as a booking. Explaination A booking confirmed for 2 rooms and prepaid. But while checking in they announce us they switch our booking to the other radison more than 10km away. In addition the new taxi course is at my cost. Amazing. Tgey are sorry to be so busy..... This means certainly a long traffic jam to go back at the airport afterall as well. That wasn t my first stay their and I ve been ok with the room accomodation here. The breakfast was average and not as good as the one from the hotel I booked at the last minutes in stead of this one. I am really disappointed per this very weird welcoming I never experienced in a Radison Blue before. Now you are aware !…

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nothing Cholan nothing Indian about this hotel,1,Hotel is named after a great Indian Hindu empire that ruled over most of South India right upto Indonesia. Yet there’s nothing Indian or Cholan about the architecture about the room. We stayed for 2 nights at the 3 BR apartment. Breakfast area is too crowded and chaotic. To add to the un-Indian un-Cholan mix they strangely had complimentary copies of Bible in the rooms for guests in 83% Hindu Chennai! To further rub it in the hotel guide for travellers listed top-6 monuments of Chennai as churches & mosques built on demolished temples! 1300 yr old Kapaleeshwar temple is listed at No.7. Then the guide says Chennai is 400 yrs old to keep with ‘secular’ credentials since the churches n mosques are 300-400 yrs old. Yet Kapaleeshwar is 1300 years old in 400 yr old Chennai😄 All my…

Hotel compensated me the next morning, but they tried at first to offer me a stupid price.   Then there is the Bar.

The Park Chennai,Chennai Trip Oct 2019,1,I stayed at The Park hotel for 2 nights from 31-Oct to 2-Nov. The booking was done through makemytrip and i made a special request for an early check-in. I called the hotel also to confirm the same. However when i reached the hotel they mentioned that early check-in is not possible. I do not understand why it cannot be informed to the guests before itself and not wait till the last moment. The check-in took 2 hours and it was of gross inconvenience to me and my family. The hotel was response was a courteous sorry. But that doesnt help me. Next was the room that i was allocated. The a/c panel was not working and i put several complaints. 2 times the mechanic came and did something which did not solve the problem.

Taj Club House,Normally i like the Taj,1,I stayed for  a saturday night and had two problems. I had a very pleasant dinner at the rooftop Kefi restaurant but got bitten to death by mosquitoes and had over 50 bites. The hotel is obviously not controlling the grounds properly. I also found the sound of the club was quite noisy in the room and it is open till 4am on a Saturday. Ask for a high room at the opposite end to the bar to get a good nights sleep. They also deliberately slow the free wifi to ensure you have to buy the premium package.…

GreenPark Chennai,Worst hotel for business trip,1,We booked this hotel for our guest from germany a month before and also have followed up from last 2 days ro reconfirm our arrival. Even at few hours before arrival. When our guest reached hotel at midnight he was denied a room mentioning no rooms available.  He has come to India for the first time and knows none in chennai. He has been left at lobby and no one care to ask him for even water. While we learnt about incident and contacted hotel and almost begged rhem to provide room and have also informed to pay double the charges. Within 5 minutes our guest was provided room. This is how this hotel works and our guest from germany is quite disappointed for his visit to India and peoples behaviour. Most unsafe and uncertain hotel to book for people visiting from other countries.…

Hilton Chennai,Bug bites,1,I stayed there for 6 nights and during the week the number of bug bites on my feet increased. On the last day to the irritation caused I asked the hotel to arrange a doctors visit to the hotel for me. Upon arrival the doctor examined my feet and advised that all 5 star hotels contain some kind of bugs. The reason why only my feet were bitten was probably due to mites within the carpet. A member of the reception staff were also present in the room when the doctor was there. The next day upon checkout I was advised that they would inspect the room. Yesterday I received inspection report for my room and surprise surprise it was all clear. Surely a doctor they have provided can’t be wrong and the fact that the bites increased over the week. Some responsibility should be taken. Very…

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",High Cost poor quality,1,The room was very big but had no dressing mirror. The main switch did not work on the key card provided rather it was direct. The cost is too heavy for the quality of room and services provided. I had a conference too and it was a horrible experience. The hall was too small for 60 pax to accommodate. The A/Cs in the hall were ineffective and we were sweating the whole day. The chairs were having no hand rest for a day long session and no tables provided for writing notes. It was too uncomfortable position to attend a full day session. The worst part was they provided one single toilet for 70 pax and only one person could go in at a time. No separate  wash rooms for gents and ladies. Such time of arrangements by a hotel for 70 persons is unbelievable that too in a metro city like…

While booking they gave us lucrative offers and took our credit card number. They did not inform us about the terms and conditions properly. On 2 nd july they told us that if we check in at 10 am they will charge us extra. So we decuded to cancel the booking. On 2nd night we cancelled the booking but the person on the phone did not inform us that the booking cannot be cancelled. They deducted Rs. 9000 without informing us. When we went there to inquire the staff was very rude and non corporating specially the manager Mr. Bala was very unhelpful and rude. They kept on insisting on the mail. Being in the hospitality business they should not behave like this and should be helpful and adjusting.…

Hilton agrees to this mistake but i am chasing bank, Hilton for weeks now! I am sure I'll get back the money.  Worst - Last week they charged me again when I have not even visited them. Again, I found out from my statement and complained. Hilton agreed that they used the wrong credit card and charged me by mistake and will refund soon! I have blocked that credit card now.  Need accounting rigour and have to see if there is any credit card data breach. Would warn the customers to be cautious on the card data.

The Park Chennai,Not a good place to stay in Chennai. Worst experience,1,"Unfortunately no website offers to rate in negative. My experience at this hotel, with my family was -5.  I was there for 2 nights from 06/19 to 06/21. I landed in Chennai at 10:00 PM and went to this hotel. My booking was for the executive suites. The receptionist at the front desk was not able to locate my booking in her system, even tough I had shared with her the booking confirmation email. When I called her supervisor, he informed me that my booking was cancelled (not sure who did that). I was stranded at midnight with my family (2 small kids). The supervisor was good enough to give me a room, thanks to him for that. The moment we went into the room on 2nd floor, it was stinking.... yuk..... still we entered as my kids were not in a mood to move anywhere else (extremely…"

GreenPark Chennai,Aweful customer care!!,1,"As one of the reviewers here, I too  called the hotel to book a banquet hall. I was met by a receptionist/customer care person who was in a pretty bad mood or one who doesn't know any customer service!!  He was saying there was no one today to answer my request but I just kept pleading him to confirm if they have any hall which can accommodate just 100 people. He sounded as if he is gonna beat me for asking him that and just hung up on me! The hotel management has to train its staff on customer service if they understand the nature of the business they're into!!…"

My company had booked this hotel when i had to travel alone. I whole of 5th floor was stinking with cigarette smell, which i just couldn't take. i decided to get out of the hotel after my Biometrics and returned back just to sleep in the hotel and next day attended the interview and walked out of the place. Rooms are not neatly maintained. Leaky taps. Felt like i stayed in a lodge instead of a 5 star hotel.…"

Hilton Chennai,Nice stay except pools are only open for westerners - I guess,1,"Pricing is good, Most of the staff's are friendly and rooms are spacious and clean. We also love their rain shower plus food in the restaurant is awesome. We stayed in fourth floor executive club and we enjoyed the access to executive club lounge.

The Park Chennai,Worst stay of all times,1,One of the worst stays that I have ever had The room walls had damps on the wall and the wooden flooring in the rooms were all broken. One could easily get hurt if one is not careful. The taps did not have water in the washroom due to some technical glitch and the service team took their own sweet time to repair. I would never go back and stay the Park as even a 3 star hotel gives better rooms and facilities…

We were given a room that stinks of smoke and stale food, used plates kept outside and not being cleared for more than a day. Booked for three, but no extra bed, no refund given. We requested for a change, they refused. The bathroom is see through and separates the room with just a see through curtain and when asked to close it, they stuck newspaper. Finally we had paid for three nights, we wanted to check out the next day, clear trip refused to refund the money saying if u like it or not, we have to stay. The most pathetic experience in my life.

The Park Chennai,Utterly Awful - Shame in the name of brand Park,1,"This is the worst room I have stayed in at any hotel till date. At 5500/- per day, the dilapidated condition of the rooms is outrageous to say the least.   The room allocated to me had broken floor boards, chipped and badly scratched tables, rickety chair with torn cover, leaking and rusted pipes in the bathroom, puffed up and peeling off plasters in the bathroom walls due to major seepage. It was clearly apparent that except for the bed nothing else in the room has been changed in a couple of decades. Even the entrance door of the hotel lobby tell the tale with all its scratches and smudges.  I asked for a change of room and was allotted another one whose floor boards and bathroom pipes were more intact than the 1st. one. As, I was on a business trip for attending my visa…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,"Overcharged INR6,000 for deposit that was never refunded!",1,"I had stayed at this hotel from 24th December to 29th December and at the time of check in, it is always customary for the hotel to charge a deposit, which I am aware is a standard procedure for any hotel. However, when I returned back to Malaysia, I notice the deposit charge to my card has not been released by the hotel. I followed this up with various personnel from the hotel and even lodged a formal complaint on the Hyatt website, as I am a member of Hyatt Goldpassport. Everyone promised to look into it, but until now, March 30th, 2014, I have not been refunded for this INR6,000 charged to my card.

The Park Chennai,Stay for 4 nights,1,"I stayed here for 4 nights. On arriving from the airport at 5am, I was asked to pay an early check in charge and then I was taken to my room. On entering the room, there was this horrible bad stench as if there was a dead animal in the room. I was so knackered from my flight that I just passed out. However later in the day, I did ask for a room change and after I had to go down to the reception and fight with the staff, they gave me a new room. This new room at least had no smell and I was relived or so I thought.   The next morning, I had a shower and realized that the whole bathroom was flooded with water.

The Park Chennai,A dreadful experience,1,"I will separate my review in two sections: Review of the room, and review of the Banquet hall.  Room Review: The room is pretty standard for a small hotel. The TV had a ""buzz"" anytime it was on, so we could not use it. The room had one chair that looked like it had been through a construction zone. Besides being dusty, paint was splattered all over it. The room decor is pretty dated. Room service was annoying. They kept calling the room to see if we were done and if they could remove the tray. The check in process was horrendous - it took 20 - 30 minutes to locate the reservation. Everybody you spoke to at the front desk seemed ignorant and either unable to understand English or pretended not to. It is a joke of a hotel.

The Park Chennai,A dreadful experience,1,"I will separate my review in two sections: Review of the room, and review of the Banquet hall.  Room Review: The room is pretty standard for a small hotel. The TV had a ""buzz"" anytime it was on, so we could not use it. The room had one chair that looked like it had been through a construction zone. Besides being dusty, paint was splattered all over it. The room decor is pretty dated. Room service was annoying. They kept calling the room to see if we were done and if they could remove the tray. The check in process was horrendous - it took 20 - 30 minutes to locate the reservation.

The Park Chennai,"Five star prices, one star quality",1,"Stayed three nights in The Park, Chennai on a business trip. Rooms were old and smelly, wooden floors on corridor partially rotten. In my opinion hotel would need total renovation. Room was dirty as well as hotel in general.  Pool was not in use but under renovation. There was nothing luxorious in this hotel even if it's stated as five star hotel, it's closer to one star in Europian standars. When I checked out, whole operation took 45 minutes. First they charged me for five nights eventhoug I stayed only four nights. I complained before paying and asked to fix it and put four nights in the bill, they disagreed and said that I stayed five nights.

The Park Chennai,TERRIBLE.,1,"Terrible hospitality! Renovations went on till 1am!! Constant drilling and hammering. They even continued after several complaints were made from several rooms.

The Park Chennai,Very dirty bathroom and poorly maintained,1,"This is probably by far the worst hotel I have stayed in, especially considering the price.  The hotel charged INR6500 (approx US$150) per night and considering the dirtiness of the room and how poorly maintained the room was, I would not recommend this hotel.  The lobby was nice and I was placed in a 7/F room (this might be the executive floor?) and so I was expecting a nice room.  This was not to be and is the worst value hotels I have ever stayed in.  After arriving into the room at 11pm, I noticed the toilet seat (not the original toilet seat but a cheap plastic one to replace the original) had some stains on it.  I thought it was just stained (which was already a bit worrying) but I took some toilet paper and rubbed the toilet seat lightly on one of the stained areas and…"

We were a group of vegetarians and would you believe it, when we were served chicken pizza not once, not twice not thrice but 4 times..each time by a different person! Cant they just have one person for one table so that they know what is being ordered?  and yeah I also almost ate a chicken pasta, when I…"

The Park Chennai,Not up to the mark!,2,"Bad Experience! I stayed at room no 7025 of  the hotel from 15th to 19th of August 2018. Despite the hotel promoting itself as a premier five star property I had a disappointing experience.  Issues:- 1. Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile. Though there are welcome drinks kept inside a cabinet, I never them offering them to anyone. 3.The rooms are dark, stinky with no approach to…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Not worth the money,2,"Its nothing better than what you get at 3 star hotel. For 5 star experience, you have to spend equivalent to 7 star. Just show off, money minded than customer service. Location also at congested road side place, you would get nothing around.…"

The Park Chennai,Stay here to find out what a 5 star is not.,2,"The decor is gaudy, when u walk down the corridors you can't help but feel you've entered a cheap brothel.Its appalling that they still check you into the rooms that are so poorly maintained.When asked I was told that they got to show occupancy. Why should a guest pay for a room where the bath tub is chipped, showers are  rusted..no mini bar...the room was stinking of dampness..only after I threatened to check out  was I shifted to the 4th floor where the rooms are renovated.appalling service.management  sucks!! …"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Service not upto Hyatt standards ,2,"I came to Hyatt for a conference. Arrived early to the convention room and they were setting up the service area for coffee, snacks, etc. I asked for coffee and instead of pouring a cup (it was ready, but snacks weren't) they said I had to come back in 30 minutes. Went to the lobby lounge area and coffee took 20 minutes to arrive. Hotel facilities were decent, but felt like a Holiday Inn or Motel 6 because of poor service. …"
The Park Chennai,Rooms are in poor upkeep,2,"I stayed in the Park, Chennai for one month. The room that I was given first was absolutely depressing with hair all over the room and bathroom and walls with damp marks. After making a noise they changed my room to 4012. The room was cleaner. The furniture is all chipped, wires dangling and lights fused. The daily house keeping trolley is similar to a wooden trolley what beggars pull on the roads. Shampoo, bath gel and laundry bags/sheets are not replenished everyday. The house keeping staff go on all fours to swab the floor. The music from the leather bar can be heard in the rooms at night.Hot water was not available on many days and the answer given was that there was an air lock..... not convincing.However food at the buffet restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and…"
The Park Chennai,A disco with rooms,2,"Don't stay here If you want a business hotel where you can hold conversations or meetings, or simply want a retreat at the of the day from the noise and bussle of Chennai. Do stay here if you want to be part of the night life scene in Chennai. There are no quiet bars, the restaurant food and service is average and the rooms (bathrooms in particular ) are not the cleanest. Checking out at night involved shouting to be heard (or to hear) the receptionist, The swimming pool did not look very inviting, shades of commonwealth games problems with water quality would be my concern,…"
Hilton Chennai,excellent property,2,"I reached early morning at 5. The taxi could not locate the hotel, so i tried to call them , but the taped message said the line has been disconnected, then i called up the booking website , they also got the same message, then i opened the laptop and located the hotel on the net . After that i reached the hotel. The hotel said , they can provide the room after 10.30 , though the booking was from that day , with a request for early check in at 6. I had to pay for a half day extra. This was unlike any other hotel, if the rooms are empty , they allow the guest to check in . Being a new hotel , the rooms are well done , the property is well designed. the breakfast is decent. the staff at the restaurant gave very good service.…"
The Park Chennai,Musty Smelling and Not Clean,2,Rooms are comfortable although showing signs of wear. Unfortunately they are musty smelling and not as clean as they should be.

The Park Chennai,a blemish to my great Indian trip,2,"i have been hopping between cities in India for the past week and i must say that my stay at the Park Hotel in Chennai was the low point for my trip. The hotel needs a serious renovation, it stinks, floors are squeaky, the night club opposite the reception area is such a shocker - basically now that i have stayed there i will discourage any of my friends and people i know never to ever consider it if they ever find themselves in Chennai.  I do believe that the Park Hotel brand can do something to rehabilitate this hotel.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…
The Park Chennai,crazy staff,2,well we stayed in a  double room.....the room was spacious enough....but  information about the hotel facilities were very inadequate....we had to call up some to find out the  closing  and opening time of each and every facility at the hotel........also the staff at the restaurants were horrible.....there were food stains  on the waiters clothes.....and the bar people  at leather bar were just to proud of themselves to be working there....also beware of the rather industrial  interiors of the hotel.....…
The Park Chennai,Basic Hotel... not 5 star worthy.,2,"Stayed for 5 days with wife and baby. We booked through MakeMyTrip.com and requested a newer remodeled room but none were available.   We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. They were throughout our stay very courteous and hospitable.   It made our stay bearable. The rooms are dated, bathroom was dingy and poorly lit. Walls had stains, don't know of what. The main floors are wood and showed its age. Paint in the corners of the room were peeling and looked like the windows haven't been washed for over a decade. We could hear hammering and masonry work from another floor between 10am to about 2pm most days. Not helpful, when you're jet lagged.   The Room Service (food) was tasty but extremely pricey. About 30% in taxes are added on top of the menu price. Compared to US prices,…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Overpriced & not worth it,2,"I booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights with family because I was looking for a hotel nearby the airport. Nothing was good about my stay. First, the rooms were to congested and small. Too many unnecessary things such as the tables & decorative stuffs. And then the toilet, the furniture were worn out and uncomfortable. Then, it took almost 1 hour for them to send the food that I ordered from room service. The staffs were not giving enough to information when a question is asked. Also, the staff which a guy from the travel desk was rude when I asked some questions.

The Park Chennai,a blemish to my great Indian trip,2,"i have been hopping between cities in India for the past week and i must say that my stay at the Park Hotel in Chennai was the low point for my trip. The hotel needs a serious renovation, it stinks, floors are squeaky, the night club opposite the reception area is such a shocker - basically now that i have stayed there i will discourage any of my friends and people i know never to ever consider it if they ever find themselves in Chennai.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Bad experience for the money you pay and for the brand you chose.,2,"It takes a few flash decision to ruin your entire vacation and that happened when we opted for Lemon tree, Chennai for a stay while returning from Pondicherry. We made the booking through make my trip however things turned upside down after reaching the hotel.   - The reception keeps over selling the plans (breakfast, airport drop, dinner...etc) even after saying a clear ""NO"". A big turn off. - The booking was made for a couple. The hotel room initially offered to us had two separate beds, we were asked to pay 1300 Rs extra if we wish to take a king size bed else no other rooms were available (Nice trick). They termed it as executive room up-gradation with inclusion of dinner for two members. After up-gradation we found the room to be exactly the same except a joint bed.  -…"

Why should a guest pay for a room where the bath tub is chipped, showers are  rusted..no mini bar...the room was stinking of dampness..only after I threatened to check out  was I shifted to the 4th floor where the rooms are renovated.appalling service.management  sucks!! …"
The Park Chennai,Most of the rooms are old and bad. Has a few good rooms which the management seems very reluctant to give.,2,"We stayed here for two nights in February for our visa appointment. We reached the hotel at around 9pm and were pretty shocked with the kind of room they provided us with - old, musty and visibly dirty. The bathroom had paan stains all over, the shower curtains were old and dirty (looks like they weren't washed for years). We called the reception and asked for a change of room, and they moved us to another room that was like 10 times worse than the first. This is the first time we've seen a hotel management moving it's guest to a worse room when being asked for a room change. We asked for another change and they just kept showing us similar bad, worse to worst rooms. Finally we decided to walk out of the hotel,  when we noticed two floors (as the lift stopped at them) seemed to…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not for the light sleeper,2,"The central atrium looks impressive, but actually acts as an echo chamber which amplifies the noise from the reception area. That is bad enough, but when they have music playing loudly until 2am, people chatting noisily until 3am, and then the cleaning and vacuuming starting it makes for a very disturbed night.  The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable). Unless you have a meeting in the hotel or very…"

At that point they refused to accept my card !!! They stood like zombies and wasted my precious 15 minutes while they checked their records !!! got delayed for my next appointment. Point is they have started a hotel with incompetent and I'll grabbed staff. Imagine if they misplaced the passport of the foreign tourists. TOURISTS BEWARE !!!

I am spending numerous weeks in Chennai and would not have been comfortable in this hotel for more than one or two nights...

Issues from my point of view:  thin hard mattress; only bed covering is sheet and light cotton spread; two lumpy pillows on the bed; all floors a marble - very cold/hard; smokey smell in the room - called front desk - they told me there are NO non-smoking rooms - woke up in the middle of the night to smoke smell from people in near by rooms; two pieces of…

I was in my shorts and tank top and no sooner I got inside the bed my thighs started itching so I changed into my jammies and since i was so tired i just fell asleep. I was awoken with a terrible itch and i saw that my entire body was covered in hives!! I went down to the reception to complain but received such a nonchalant response, and when i asked for a medicine, they told me that they don't keep any thus cant help me with it. After a while they changed my room but the lining​ of the new room too was not pristine. Apart from this the food is nice and the staff try to sympathise with you. My advice is don't stay here and look somewhere else. …"
GreenPark Chennai,Poor attention to detail,2,"We went in August and stayed for  a week and myself and my two children were looking forward to a dip in the swimming pool every day to escape the Chennai heat - Alas, the pool was closed for maintenance !! - without any no prior notification!!!. A five star hotel expecting foreign visitors should not close its swimming pool for maintenace during the peak holiday season (ie, school holiday period in the US, UK, Europe and Canada, when a lot of foreign tourists visit India). Can the yearly maintenance not be carried out in March? Also, twice (Sundays on both occasions), I saw people vomitting near the barbecue by the swimming pool - they were high on alcohol. Looked like they were locals attending one of the parties in the many function rooms in the Hotel. Too many of the people…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Bubble bursting experience it was!,2,"ITC Grand Chola, to start with, it's just living off its name. The service right from the check-in formalities it's terrible. They make you wait for almost 15-20 mins, the desk staff are on calls and just don't even excuse themselves before they leave, they would keep you waiting. They have coupon for lunch and dinner, which isn't rightly given. There is clearly no coordination between different departments. We had lunch at Cafe Mercara, the staff there are very rude and strange, even after repeating the order, they will miss out on some food items, you need to ask them for basic things like water, it's like reminding them their own duties. We had asked for some extra bowl of rice, they just dint show up and completely ignored the order even after requesting them twice. We…"
The Park Chennai,Good For Nothing,2,"This hotel is just an average hotel and one of the worst of The Park chain of hotels. However, you will be surprised to see the crowd here as they come unusually in larger numbers. Most of the guest stay here for its strategic location which is very near to American consulate. Staying one night for Visa purpose in a so-so hotel doesn't hurt unless you care about your own money which you might have paid for this stay (Most people don't as there stay will be borne by their company). For super expensive food, smelly lobby, unmaintained  floors and very average buffet - I can't rate it more than 2 stars.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good looking property.

Things didn't go so well after we opened the doors to our rooms. A strong, musty odor greeted us. The bathrooms hat water stains and white mold growing on the wall. To make a long story short: We were shown 11 rooms in total. My friends, who are sensitive to odors, decided to find another hotel to stay in. I settled for the least offensive room and stayed for 3 nights. Just came back home and when I opened my suitcase, the mustly odor had traveled back home with me in my clothes.  It's really a shame, because the staff is so very nice and tried to accommodate us. We actually felt bad for them, but what…"
Hilton Chennai,No alcohol served,2,"Many hotels are impacted by no alcohol being served in hotels. The Hilton being one of them. So if you're looking for a place to have a drink after work or a social gathering, avoid staying at the Hilton. In the future I will be looking for a different hotel. …"

After that i reached the hotel. The hotel said , they can provide the room after 10.30 , though the booking was from that day , with a request for early check in at 6. I had to pay for a half day extra. This was unlike any other hotel, if the rooms are empty , they allow the guest to check in . Being a new hotel , the rooms are well done , the property is well designed. the breakfast is decent. the staff at the restaurant gave very good service.…"

This is my experience the first day and the first few hours at Hilton Chennai in November 2013: •	Too low office chair for the work desk in the room. Really bad seating position for work on a laptop. •	Safe was not working and had to get new batteries. Should have been checked or changed beforehand. •	There is a torch in the room, which is good to have. But it was not working and had to be replaced. This should have been checked beforehand. •	Fruit was delivered to my room, three apples, after I have checked in and not prior to my arrival, that is strange and was unnecessary disturbing when I was working.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Stix (chinese restaurant) sucks!,2,"This review is in specific for the Chinese Restaurant. I have never stayed at the hotel, and hoping im reviewing in the right spot! The restaurant has some of the worst ventilation I have ever come across, even in a 3 star hotel. Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze. Since more than 50% of the seats seemed to be near the open kitchen, I was a little surprised by the wait staff assuring us they could have given us a better table near the lobby, which was now full.  The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"

The Park Chennai,Rooms are in poor upkeep,2,"I stayed in the Park, Chennai for one month. The room that I was given first was absolutely depressing with hair all over the room and bathroom and walls with damp marks. After making a noise they changed my room to 4012. The room was cleaner. The furniture is all chipped, wires dangling and lights fused. The daily house keeping trolley is similar to a wooden trolley what beggars pull on the roads. Shampoo, bath gel and laundry bags/sheets are not replenished everyday. The house keeping staff go on all fours to swab the floor. The music from the leather bar can be heard in the rooms at night.Hot water was not available on many days and the answer given was that there was an air lock..... not convincing.However food at the buffet restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and…"
The Park Chennai,5 star for a caveman..... maybe.,2,"We recently had a 2 night visit to The Park. The hotel is definitely not the 5 stars it rates itself to be and maybe the management need to visit real 5 star properties and re-evaluate themselves. I rate The Park 3.5 stars (at best).  The entrance is very bland and like no other hotel I have been to. Just a huge wall with big wooden door. No signage or anything to indicate you are at a hotel.  The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.   Like others have mentioned, this hotel is very run down and in urgent need of attention. The rooms have a strange smell and the finishing touches like painting and joinery are of a poor standard. It seems that not a lot of thought went into water run off in the…"

When I got to room I was surpised there was AC but was quickly in for a shock. The AC is set at a very cold temperature where I cannot adjust with thermostat. And this is where I got to dealt with the very unhelpful room service service. On and On but, I will leave it here since I will not be back.…"

In 2 days got locked out of my room twice and you have to really run behind people and call reception multiple times to get some one to help or open the door for you, they had some technical problem with the room lock.

The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale.

Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile. Though there are welcome drinks kept inside a cabinet, I never them offering them to anyone. 3.The rooms are dark, stinky with no approach to…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good looking property. Just couldn't find a room that didn't have a strong musty odor,2,"Arriving for a 3 night stay last week, myself and a couple of friends we admired the beautiful lobby and were pleased with the restaurant selection located right on the property. Things didn't go so well after we opened the doors to our rooms. A strong, musty odor greeted us. The bathrooms hat water stains and white mold growing on the wall. To make a long story short: We were shown 11 rooms in total. My friends, who are sensitive to odors, decided to find another hotel to stay in. I settled for the least offensive room and stayed for 3 nights. Just came back home and when I opened my suitcase, the mustly odor had traveled back home with me in my clothes.  It's really a shame, because the staff is so very nice and tried to accommodate us. We actually felt bad for them, but what…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…

GreenPark Chennai,Good hotel let down by bad management.,2,"I had stayed in this hotel numerous times and the food and the room can be the only highlights. Right From the reception you get the impression that there is going to be a hiccup with the way you are treated.

The location is great, food is top notch just a change in the attitude of the management and minor tweaks in the room will make this hotel a good stay.…"
The Park Chennai,Dirty room and bathroom ,2, I had stayed with this  hotel on 26-04-17 and check out on 27-04-17. I want to say that my stay was really bad as I found the room and toilet very dirty the paint was chipped on the room wall and over all the room was really dirty. I chose this  hotel seeing the rating on trip advisor and also on booking.com but am sorry to say this hotel was rated 5 star on booking.com but I did not feel a single thing 5 star about the hotel. The hotel needs a huge renovation over all. The walk way from lift to room was very bad it felt as if I was in a lodge.really embarrassed to stay with this hotel. Not worth the money.…
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Bad experience for the money you pay and for the brand you chose.,2,"It takes a few flash decision to ruin your entire vacation and that happened when we opted for Lemon tree, Chennai for a stay while returning from Pondicherry. We made the booking through make my trip however things turned upside down after reaching the hotel.   - The reception keeps over selling the plans (breakfast, airport drop, dinner...etc) even after saying a clear ""NO"". A big turn off. - The booking was made for a couple. The hotel room initially offered to us had two separate beds, we were asked to pay 1300 Rs extra if we wish to take a king size bed else no other rooms were available (Nice trick). They termed it as executive room up-gradation with inclusion of dinner for two members. After up-gradation we found the room to be exactly the same except a joint bed.  -…"

The Park Chennai,a blemish to my great Indian trip,2,"i have been hopping between cities in India for the past week and i must say that my stay at the Park Hotel in Chennai was the low point for my trip. The hotel needs a serious renovation, it stinks, floors are squeaky, the night club opposite the reception area is such a shocker - basically now that i have stayed there i will discourage any of my friends and people i know never to ever consider it if they ever find themselves in Chennai.

The Park Chennai,Disappointing overpriced impersonation of a boutique hotel,2,"We had hoped for an upmarket boutiquey hotel for our first couple of nights of our trip.  But 1 - The pre-booked taxi was not present at the airport - our flight had been delayed, but nevertheless, when we called them, they suggested we just grab a cab. Not easy with only 2000 rupee notes ( thanks Mr Modhi). Ended up overpaying in sterling 2 - although we had requested early checkin, we checked in and spent the next hour and a half in the lobby watching 2 reception staff deal with a large queue 3 - finally given a room, and to be fair an upgraded one. But the sofa was stained, the shower curtain was rubbish so bathroom floor flooded( but did not drain); so heaven knows what the basic rooms are like 4 - tried asking the travel desk about hiring a car and driver to Kanchipuram and…"

The Park Chennai,"5 star only for the name sake, junk service",2,"Stayed during my 2 day trip to Chennai. For name sake its 5 star but if they ask me its just like any other 2 star avg and below avg hotel. Have stayed in Radisson and Taj Vivanta on couple of occasions and this place is way below their standards. For a water bottle you have to call thrice in half an hour and then only they delivered. In 2 days got locked out of my room twice and you have to really run behind people and call reception multiple times to get some one to help or open the door for you, they had some technical problem with the room lock. View in the side facing rooms is just an empty barren half constructed building thats all, nothing else. Food was just average but priced 5 star price. Breakfast was ok but again spread was very limited if you are pure-veg person. In…"

After that i reached the hotel. The hotel said , they can provide the room after 10.30 , though the booking was from that day , with a request for early check in at 6. I had to pay for a half day extra. This was unlike any other hotel, if the rooms are empty , they allow the guest to check in . Being a new hotel , the rooms are well done , the property is well designed. the breakfast is decent. the staff at the restaurant gave very good service.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Upgrade I did not want ,2,"Upgraded to a two bedroom apartment with small rooms.

Missing French press spoiled my mood to have my important cup of coffee. When you reach at 11 in the night and you know the hotel is a small maze, you expect someone to guide you towards your room.

Its is minimum courtesy to inform weather you have upgraded us or not, Its not at all professional to inform us we were upgraded and not being done in fact. We did wait 10 mins for them to process the upgrade which was never done.

The Park Chennai,Basic Hotel... not 5 star worthy.,2,"Stayed for 5 days with wife and baby. We booked through MakeMyTrip.com and requested a newer remodeled room but none were available.   We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. They were throughout our stay very courteous and hospitable.   It made our stay bearable. The rooms are dated, bathroom was dingy and poorly lit. Walls had stains, don't know of what. The main floors are wood and showed its age. Paint in the corners of the room were peeling and looked like the windows haven't been washed for over a decade. We could hear hammering and masonry work from another floor between 10am to about 2pm most days. Not helpful, when you're jet lagged.   The Room Service (food) was tasty but extremely pricey. About 30% in taxes are added on top of the menu price. Compared to US prices,…"

GreenPark Chennai,Poor attention to detail,2,"We went in August and stayed for  a week and myself and my two children were looking forward to a dip in the swimming pool every day to escape the Chennai heat - Alas, the pool was closed for maintenance !! - without any no prior notification!!!. A five star hotel expecting foreign visitors should not close its swimming pool for maintenace during the peak holiday season (ie, school holiday period in the US, UK, Europe and Canada, when a lot of foreign tourists visit India). Can the yearly maintenance not be carried out in March? Also, twice (Sundays on both occasions), I saw people vomitting near the barbecue by the swimming pool - they were high on alcohol.

During check in,  hotel receptionist said no indication of any requests.  End up change of room on our 1st day stay at night after we back from day tour, we were tired!!  Look at how ignorant the hotel Management is, even the duty Manager Ayushi!! She is not an asset to the hotel.

I was awoken with a terrible itch and i saw that my entire body was covered in hives!! I went down to the reception to complain but received such a nonchalant response, and when i asked for a medicine, they told me that they don't keep any thus cant help me with it. After a while they changed my room but the lining​ of the new room too was not pristine. Apart from this the food is nice and the staff try to sympathise with you.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Stix (chinese restaurant) sucks!,2,"This review is in specific for the Chinese Restaurant. I have never stayed at the hotel, and hoping im reviewing in the right spot! The restaurant has some of the worst ventilation I have ever come across, even in a 3 star hotel. Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze. Since more than 50% of the seats seemed to be near the open kitchen, I was a little surprised by the wait staff assuring us they could have given us a better table near the lobby, which was now full.  The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"

I arrived around 9:30 PM, and the reservation desk took a while (around 10 - 15mins) to get the room ready. Moreover, the hotel staffs at the reservation desk were multitasking, keeping me waited at the counter itself. This itself didn't give me a good impression on the reception. The receptionist just gave the room key without informing me anything about where the breakfast will be served / do I have any luggage to be carried to the room. I had to remind them about my luggage to be carried to my room. They gave me a room in the second floor.  1.

Really not much. I wrote the list of repairs as well as personal thoughts in pencil on a pad provided by the hotel and left it on the desk among tons of other business papers.  When we got back, two maids and the head of housekeeping were in our room, apologizing that the service wasn't perfect.  When I asked how they knew about my small complaints, they said they had read my note.  THEY READ MY PRIVATE NOTE.  And they were very proud that they had been proactive.

The Park Chennai,Tardy rooms,2,"The Park is one of the preferred hotels on our company's internal travel portal and hence i had no hesitation in booking this hotel for our stay in Chennai. We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again. To start off the upholstery on the  sofa in the room was worn out, the shower head in the bathroom had rust stains all over them. The hotel room itself was dull and unispiring.

GreenPark Chennai,does not meet the conditions of a 4-star hotel,2,"It is a hotel where there are continually conventions and weddings which create a noisy atmosphere that sometimes makes it difficult to sleep. Privacy is something very important that is not met in this hotel, cleaners who enter the room without calling and a vigilance by the staff of the hotel that comes to take pictures of personal belongings, fact that is proven. The manager of the hotel does not respond to the height of a hotel of its characteristics, remaining in evidence in situations that have made us feel very uncomfortable with their treatment. the cleanliness in some parts of the hotel is not as expected in European hotels, creating the perfect conditions for mosquitoes in bathrooms for example.  the bathrooms of the rooms are not cleaned properly every day, as well as…"
The Park Chennai,Not fit to be a 5 star. Basic facilities compromised,2,"Being in India you expect hotels to have water for washing up in the WC. Well, this hotel thinks it is located in a European district with only toilet paper.  That's not all. The hotel & room services are very disappointing given the fact Park is a known chain in India. The room has no glasses to drink water. So you use the cans and bottles as it is. There is no iron in the room considering this is a popular business hotel.   How do I even start on a good thing about the hotel except for a very polite front office staff.   There are no electric points near the bed in reach. The one point near the bed is below the side table and not accessible unless you get down on your knees and have a long arm like mine.

The Park Chennai,Rooms are in poor upkeep,2,"I stayed in the Park, Chennai for one month. The room that I was given first was absolutely depressing with hair all over the room and bathroom and walls with damp marks. After making a noise they changed my room to 4012. The room was cleaner. The furniture is all chipped, wires dangling and lights fused. The daily house keeping trolley is similar to a wooden trolley what beggars pull on the roads. Shampoo, bath gel and laundry bags/sheets are not replenished everyday. The house keeping staff go on all fours to swab the floor. The music from the leather bar can be heard in the rooms at night.Hot water was not available on many days and the answer given was that there was an air lock..... not convincing.However food at the buffet restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and…"
The Park Chennai,parking Mad,2,"This was an expensive but vastly overrated hotel. The staff were largely unprofessional (except for the Club suite), the rooms initially were grubby and smelly and I had to move 3 times in 2 days due to the poor conditions. The rooms did not have some basic items and I threatened to leave before being offered a salvage deal in the Club suite which was the only area approaching anywhere near 5 star standard during my whole time there. I would not advise anyone to stay here except in the Club section if you want anything above basic 3 star. The food however was acceptable and the spa was good but expensive.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not recommend -,2,"Overall, was my first time in India and was excited to be staying at a Hyatt hotel. But, after the moment I walked in I was in for a surprise. In the lobby there was no AC it was humid as hell and mosquitoes all over the front desk. It got worst from there, elevator same thing, humid, hot no ac, and mosquitoes. When I got to room I was surpised there was AC but was quickly in for a shock. The AC is set at a very cold temperature where I cannot adjust with thermostat. And this is where I got to dealt with the very unhelpful room service service. On and On but, I will leave it here since I will not be back.…"
The Park Chennai,As everyone says: 'Well deserved poor rating',2,The only reason that everyone stays here is that this hotel is next to US Embassy.

GreenPark Chennai,Good hotel let down by bad management.,2,"I had stayed in this hotel numerous times and the food and the room can be the only highlights. Right From the reception you get the impression that there is going to be a hiccup with the way you are treated. Mr. Alagumalai who was the person in charge was by far the most unsuitable manager I have encountered in all of my hotel experience. The location is great, food is top notch just a change in the attitude of the management and minor tweaks in the room will make this hotel a good stay.…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Below Average,2,"What would you feel, if you land at the hotel in midnight and find the frond desk and lobby deserted?  Landed late night at  Chennai, reached hotel at midnight found the lobby deserted, no one at the reception to receive.  I requested for a King Size Non Smoking room on higher floor. Reiterated it to the fron desk executive twice, and to my surprise, I was give a claustrophobic, queen bed 8x8 room. The front desk executive didn't even bother to inform me.   Horrible and pathetic service.  Food is average, I tried dessert, couldn't differentiate whether it was ""Carrot Kheer"" or sugar syrup.  Ahmedabad, Delhi and then Chennai, I have lost faith in Lemontree Chain.   Very very disappointed   The only property that till date I found good is Bengaluru Ulsoor Lake. I may continue…"
Taj Club House,Unfriendly Front Office Male staff!,2,"I was on a family visit to Chennai few weeks ago. I have stayed in Taj Club House a few years back as well.  In comparison to the previous years, the customer service has gone down the drain. The pleasant female staff have been replaced by unfriendly male front office staff who look like they have no clue what they are doing!!! Where did all the pleasant female staff go??? Ridiculous service!! THE ONLY SAVING GRACE OF TAJ CLUB HOUSE IS THE SINGLE WOMAN Ms.RAJESHWARI WHOSE WELCOMING DEMEANOR AND CUSTOMER CARE MAKES IT WORTHWHILE TO STAY IN THIS PLACE. The chef Mr.RAJENDRAN is another person who makes your morning pleasant to stay.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…

The Park Chennai,Terrible check-in experience,2,"Arrived 23Oct about 11pm+ after a long flight and all i need was a quick check in and a room so I can get some sleep. Pickup from airport was smooth, but the moment i reached the hotel, the ordeal began.   Check-in: There was about 4-5pax at reception, of which i think about 3 are trainees who was helping the 2main check in guy to photocopy passport and just stand around watching people. There were 3 group of pax checking in at that time, 1 in midst of check in, myself and another grp of 3pax who was trying to check in. While waiting to be served, I can immediately noticed the unhappy faces from all the 2 main check in staff at the desk. As we are all being ignored pretty much, we had to brace the frown and tried to get the guys’ attention to help us chck in. After some waiting,…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Overpriced & not worth it,2,"I booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights with family because I was looking for a hotel nearby the airport. Nothing was good about my stay. First, the rooms were to congested and small. Too many unnecessary things such as the tables & decorative stuffs. And then the toilet, the furniture were worn out and uncomfortable. Then, it took almost 1 hour for them to send the food that I ordered from room service. The staffs were not giving enough to information when a question is asked. Also, the staff which a guy from the travel desk was rude when I asked some questions. And the worst incident was when I found a HALF EATEN APPLE under the study desk. It was terrible. The price was just too expensive for the stay and not worth it at all. I used to stay in The Hilton chennai, and…"

The Park Chennai,Tardy rooms,2,"The Park is one of the preferred hotels on our company's internal travel portal and hence i had no hesitation in booking this hotel for our stay in Chennai. We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again.

Taj Club House,Hit and miss,2,"I feel like this hotel is very hit and miss. I choose taj because I expected basic things to be done correctly.  But the rooms was dirty on arrival, the breakfast restaurant is complete chaos, and quality of food and the service was awful. I even went to the trouble of asking the hotel to adjust my room rate (which they did for the extra night) because I didn’t want to deal with the restaurant downstairs for inclusive breakfast, prefer to eat breakfast outside after that.  I can understand some of the comments from other reviews about service, because the front of house reception gives the impression that they are a care free,  and don’t really pay attention ( no real response other than they are sorry)  ... quite a different experience that I have had previously at Taj Lands…"
The Park Chennai,Basic Hotel... not 5 star worthy.,2,"Stayed for 5 days with wife and baby. We booked through MakeMyTrip.com and requested a newer remodeled room but none were available.   We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. They were throughout our stay very courteous and hospitable.   It made our stay bearable. The rooms are dated, bathroom was dingy and poorly lit. Walls had stains, don't know of what. The main floors are wood and showed its age. Paint in the corners of the room were peeling and looked like the windows haven't been washed for over a decade. We could hear hammering and masonry work from another floor between 10am to about 2pm most days. Not helpful, when you're jet lagged.   The Room Service (food) was tasty but extremely pricey. About 30% in taxes are added on top of the menu price. Compared to US prices,…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Disappointing - definitely unsuitable for tourists,2,"As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby at around 10pm on a Friday night, I felt disappointed.  The hotel's website had indeed exaggerated the size and grandeur of the lobby, and it was filled with noise and people. The seating in the lounge area had lost its springs many moons ago.  Over two nights I came to realize that the hotel is overpriced and in need of renovation.  The corridors are dowdy and our room, though with a modern bathroom, was a gloomy mish mash of dark furniture and seating.  The crowded breakfast area is indeed in need of renovation - with scratched fittings and sagging chairs. We sought refuge in the Radisson Club, but this was claustrophobic and noisy.  An important point is that this is definitely not a hotel suitable for tourists. It's close to the…"
The Park Chennai,Outright pathetic! ,2,"I stayed here for two nights and was the most horrible hotel experience in a long time.  First, the room we were given had a distinct odour, which we realized came from used wet clothes in the bathroom.

Now, when in the new room, i saw all toiletries missing, and asked for housekeeping. The housekeeping guy is asking me what all I need- isn't a bath towel, a face towel, soap and dental kit a normal thing? I had to spell out the details.  Food: Average is the word.

A big turn off. - The booking was made for a couple. The hotel room initially offered to us had two separate beds, we were asked to pay 1300 Rs extra if we wish to take a king size bed else no other rooms were available (Nice trick). They termed it as executive room up-gradation with inclusion of dinner for two members. After up-gradation we found the room to be exactly the same except a joint bed.  -…"
The Park Chennai,Not the best..,2,"Stayed at a suite for two days at this hotel. While check in was fairly smooth, this hotel certainly doesn't have the quality of a 5 star hotel that it claims to be. The hotel appears quite dated, both at the reception as well as in the rooms.  The location of the hotel is great if you're coming to get your US visa.  The carpets in the room was stained and so was the floor. The sink in the bathroom was completely blocked and required me to call someone in to fix it. I wonder why hotels don't get these things done themselves when the room is serviced? Why does it require a guest to call in?  Even though this was a suite, there was no hairdryer available and it had to be requested for. (Took 40 mins and 2 calls to arrive)  Reception did not give me a 2nd key card because they had…"

The service is very poor, basic things like sufficient napkins, salt and pepper shaker, water etc. is not available...It is an interminable wait...Dont understand how a well known hotel can function with such shoddy service...There is total lack of training of the front line staff...

The Park Chennai,Most of the rooms are old and bad. Has a few good rooms which the management seems very reluctant to give.,2,"We stayed here for two nights in February for our visa appointment. We reached the hotel at around 9pm and were pretty shocked with the kind of room they provided us with - old, musty and visibly dirty. The bathroom had paan stains all over, the shower curtains were old and dirty (looks like they weren't washed for years). We called the reception and asked for a change of room, and they moved us to another room that was like 10 times worse than the first. This is the first time we've seen a hotel management moving it's guest to a worse room when being asked for a room change. We asked for another change and they just kept showing us similar bad, worse to worst rooms. Finally we decided to walk out of the hotel,  when we noticed two floors (as the lift stopped at them) seemed to…"

After that i reached the hotel. The hotel said , they can provide the room after 10.30 , though the booking was from that day , with a request for early check in at 6. I had to pay for a half day extra. This was unlike any other hotel, if the rooms are empty , they allow the guest to check in .

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.  I stayed at the Raddison hotel, booked through Orbitz.  The Raddison was not cheap, well over 5,000 Rupees for a few hours of stay! I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble. I guess I can live with the exhorbitant price…"

The Park Chennai,Dirty room and bathroom ,2, I had stayed with this  hotel on 26-04-17 and check out on 27-04-17. I want to say that my stay was really bad as I found the room and toilet very dirty the paint was chipped on the room wall and over all the room was really dirty. I chose this  hotel seeing the rating on trip advisor and also on booking.com but am sorry to say this hotel was rated 5 star on booking.com but I did not feel a single thing 5 star about the hotel. The hotel needs a huge renovation over all. The walk way from lift to room was very bad it felt as if I was in a lodge.really embarrassed to stay with this hotel. Not worth the money.…
GreenPark Chennai,Horrible experience ... Beware travellers ,2,"If there is one mistake I can ignore ... Bell boy takes me to an already occupied room, reception misplaces my ID, my luggage wrongly tagged at departure. God saved me on all these occasions. But the mother of all goof up... Although my company booked they said they had no prior authorisation letter... I let them speak to my office person ... Then I produced my credit card to make payment. At that point they refused to accept my card !!! They stood like zombies and wasted my precious 15 minutes while they checked their records !!! got delayed for my next appointment. Point is they have started a hotel with incompetent and I'll grabbed staff. Imagine if they misplaced the passport of the foreign tourists. TOURISTS BEWARE !!!

Landed late night at  Chennai, reached hotel at midnight found the lobby deserted, no one at the reception to receive.  I requested for a King Size Non Smoking room on higher floor. Reiterated it to the fron desk executive twice, and to my surprise, I was give a claustrophobic, queen bed 8x8 room. The front desk executive didn't even bother to inform me.   Horrible and pathetic service.  Food is average, I tried dessert, couldn't differentiate whether it was ""Carrot Kheer"" or sugar syrup.

One thing which was aptly clear to me is that the place can barely offer bed and breakfast and nothing else.

The TV will not have HDMI cords - The washroom will not have hand towels etc. The rooms are contemporary and the design is chic.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Disappointing stay, best to avoid ",2,"Am writing this review while still staying here so there can be more incidents after this which may make me change my views. Had chosen this hotel coz: 1) my previous stays in park Hyatt and Hyatt regency were not that great. 2) had lays has great expedites staying in other ITC hotels like ITC Gardenia, etc  But maybe due to high expectations was disappointed and let me start why : 1) flight was delayed by an hour but pick up was there on time. But this was the smallest car pick up I have ever had. An old Honda city. I was like ok. Any quad nearby so why worry  2) when u reached the hotel there where like buses and vans on the porch with hundreds of people. It seems it was some office function which got over.

They make you wait for almost 15-20 mins, the desk staff are on calls and just don't even excuse themselves before they leave, they would keep you waiting. They have coupon for lunch and dinner, which isn't rightly given. There is clearly no coordination between different departments. We had lunch at Cafe Mercara, the staff there are very rude and strange, even after repeating the order, they will miss out on some food items, you need to ask them for basic things like water, it's like reminding them their own duties. We had asked for some extra bowl of rice, they just dint show up and completely ignored the order even after requesting them twice. We…"

After that i reached the hotel. The hotel said , they can provide the room after 10.30 , though the booking was from that day , with a request for early check in at 6. I had to pay for a half day extra. This was unlike any other hotel, if the rooms are empty , they allow the guest to check in .

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not for the light sleeper,2,"The central atrium looks impressive, but actually acts as an echo chamber which amplifies the noise from the reception area. That is bad enough, but when they have music playing loudly until 2am, people chatting noisily until 3am, and then the cleaning and vacuuming starting it makes for a very disturbed night.  The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable). Unless you have a meeting in the hotel or very…"

Everyone seems to be nervous but they don't know what needs to be done. Restaurant service slow and unreliable.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",They snoop through private belongings,2,"The hotel is beautiful.   But the maids look through your belongings:  I had written a list of small things that needed improvements in the room, small details such as the fact that toiletries were for men, lights that didn't switch off in the bathroom, and a leaky faucet.  Really not much. I wrote the list of repairs as well as personal thoughts in pencil on a pad provided by the hotel and left it on the desk among tons of other business papers.  When we got back, two maids and the head of housekeeping were in our room, apologizing that the service wasn't perfect.  When I asked how they knew about my small complaints, they said they had read my note.  THEY READ MY PRIVATE NOTE.  And they were very proud that they had been proactive.  Adding insult to injury, we had to endure a…"
The Park Chennai,5 star for a caveman..... maybe.,2,"We recently had a 2 night visit to The Park. The hotel is definitely not the 5 stars it rates itself to be and maybe the management need to visit real 5 star properties and re-evaluate themselves. I rate The Park 3.5 stars (at best).  The entrance is very bland and like no other hotel I have been to. Just a huge wall with big wooden door. No signage or anything to indicate you are at a hotel.  The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.   Like others have mentioned, this hotel is very run down and in urgent need of attention. The rooms have a strange smell and the finishing touches like painting and joinery are of a poor standard.

We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. They were throughout our stay very courteous and hospitable.   It made our stay bearable. The rooms are dated, bathroom was dingy and poorly lit. Walls had stains, don't know of what. The main floors are wood and showed its age. Paint in the corners of the room were peeling and looked like the windows haven't been washed for over a decade. We could hear hammering and masonry work from another floor between 10am to about 2pm most days. Not helpful, when you're jet lagged.   The Room Service (food) was tasty but extremely pricey.

Upon check-in, we had been ""upgraded"" as the hotel was running full on standard double rooms. However, upon check-out, I was grossly over-charged (by 8% extra) as the hotel staff claimed that the service tax must be applied on the non-discounted rate (ie the rate of the higher-category room). I wasn't informed by the staff upfront, I noticed the problem myself (unfortunately after paying) and when I pointed to the discrepancy with my confirmation slip (from Blu Radisson website), the hotel staff refused to buldge and annoyingly referred to the…"

The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale.

Issues from my point of view:  thin hard mattress; only bed covering is sheet and light cotton spread; two lumpy pillows on the bed; all floors a marble - very cold/hard; smokey smell in the room - called front desk - they told me there are NO non-smoking rooms - woke up in the middle of the night to smoke smell from people in near by rooms; two pieces of…
The Park Chennai,a blemish to my great Indian trip,2,"i have been hopping between cities in India for the past week and i must say that my stay at the Park Hotel in Chennai was the low point for my trip. The hotel needs a serious renovation, it stinks, floors are squeaky, the night club opposite the reception area is such a shocker - basically now that i have stayed there i will discourage any of my friends and people i know never to ever consider it if they ever find themselves in Chennai.  I do believe that the Park Hotel brand can do something to rehabilitate this hotel.…"
Taj Club House,Hit and miss,2,"I feel like this hotel is very hit and miss. I choose taj because I expected basic things to be done correctly.  But the rooms was dirty on arrival, the breakfast restaurant is complete chaos, and quality of food and the service was awful. I even went to the trouble of asking the hotel to adjust my room rate (which they did for the extra night) because I didn’t want to deal with the restaurant downstairs for inclusive breakfast, prefer to eat breakfast outside after that.  I can understand some of the comments from other reviews about service, because the front of house reception gives the impression that they are a care free,  and don’t really pay attention ( no real response other than they are sorry)  ... quite a different experience that I have had previously at Taj Lands…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Overpriced & not worth it,2,"I booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights with family because I was looking for a hotel nearby the airport. Nothing was good about my stay. First, the rooms were to congested and small. Too many unnecessary things such as the tables & decorative stuffs. And then the toilet, the furniture were worn out and uncomfortable. Then, it took almost 1 hour for them to send the food that I ordered from room service. The staffs were not giving enough to information when a question is asked. Also, the staff which a guy from the travel desk was rude when I asked some questions. And the worst incident was when I found a HALF EATEN APPLE under the study desk. It was terrible. The price was just too expensive for the stay and not worth it at all. I used to stay in The Hilton chennai, and…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Worst group lunch @Madras pavilion restaurant, not recommended.",2,"Been to a team lunch @ Madras Pavailion restaurant.   The ambience of the hotel and the restaurant was great, but the seating, food and service was very poor.   They arranged seating for 100+ people in 3 tables, so it was terrible. Staff treated our team like cattle. One lady staff in the restaurant desk asked me ""if I am with all 'these people'?"" Apparenlty, she wanted to stop me from sitting in any other (properly arranged) table.  Worst language and service I had seen in any hotel in this category.  The spread was big, many starters, main courses and desserts. But the place was very crowded and it was hard to find the right food. The spread was too widespread. Very few service personnel was there to help and the food quality was below average - except few items like Kozhi…"
The Park Chennai,"5 star only for the name sake, junk service",2,"Stayed during my 2 day trip to Chennai. For name sake its 5 star but if they ask me its just like any other 2 star avg and below avg hotel. Have stayed in Radisson and Taj Vivanta on couple of occasions and this place is way below their standards. For a water bottle you have to call thrice in half an hour and then only they delivered. In 2 days got locked out of my room twice and you have to really run behind people and call reception multiple times to get some one to help or open the door for you, they had some technical problem with the room lock. View in the side facing rooms is just an empty barren half constructed building thats all, nothing else. Food was just average but priced 5 star price. Breakfast was ok but again spread was very limited if you are pure-veg person. In…"

Staying one night for Visa purpose in a so-so hotel doesn't hurt unless you care about your own money which you might have paid for this stay (Most people don't as there stay will be borne by their company).

The Park Chennai,Don’t expect to sleep. ,2,"The Park’s lobby is a wonderful example of flashy design winning out over functionality and guest convenience. The furniture in the lobby is perversely uncomfortable.   The restaurant and bar open off the large reception atrium space. The bar hosts a variety of events which involve loud music. Both the nights I stayed the music was blaring out until past 3am and, as the rooms are off the atrium, I got very little sleep.   The rooms are a little more standard in terms of design. The upper floors have a halfhearted sort of Indian Cinema theme with old cinema posters and images of various film stars. I found the bed large but quite soft. Wardrobe hanging space was limited. A lot of the furnishings were a little tired. There are very few electrical sockets and some located very…"

The Park Chennai,parking Mad,2,"This was an expensive but vastly overrated hotel. The staff were largely unprofessional (except for the Club suite), the rooms initially were grubby and smelly and I had to move 3 times in 2 days due to the poor conditions. The rooms did not have some basic items and I threatened to leave before being offered a salvage deal in the Club suite which was the only area approaching anywhere near 5 star standard during my whole time there. I would not advise anyone to stay here except in the Club section if you want anything above basic 3 star. The food however was acceptable and the spa was good but expensive.…"
Hilton Chennai,Poor service!!!,2,"We ended up staying in Hilton Chennai one unfortunate day when, me and my husband, we got locked out of our house! It was late night and we got directed to a centralised call centre for our room reservations. This worked fine and we got our confirmation by mail.  When we reached the hotel, we were asked to provide id cards. My husband provided his.I wasn't carrying one as we got out locked out of the house with just my husband's wallet (thankful for at least that!) We tried explaining this situation to the manager who was refusing to give us the room with out my ID card.They claimed that this clause was mentioned in the confirmation mail.  When we checked the mail, this clause was not to be found anywhere.  At 2 am, my husband(who is generally very even tempered) had to raise…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not recommend -,2,"Overall, was my first time in India and was excited to be staying at a Hyatt hotel. But, after the moment I walked in I was in for a surprise. In the lobby there was no AC it was humid as hell and mosquitoes all over the front desk. It got worst from there, elevator same thing, humid, hot no ac, and mosquitoes. When I got to room I was surpised there was AC but was quickly in for a shock. The AC is set at a very cold temperature where I cannot adjust with thermostat. And this is where I got to dealt with the very unhelpful room service service. On and On but, I will leave it here since I will not be back.…"

But the maids look through your belongings:  I had written a list of small things that needed improvements in the room, small details such as the fact that toiletries were for men, lights that didn't switch off in the bathroom, and a leaky faucet.  Really not much. I wrote the list of repairs as well as personal thoughts in pencil on a pad provided by the hotel and left it on the desk among tons of other business papers.  When we got back, two maids and the head of housekeeping were in our room, apologizing that the service wasn't perfect.  When I asked how they knew about my small complaints, they said they had read my note.  THEY READ MY PRIVATE NOTE.  And they were very proud that they had been proactive.  Adding insult to injury, we had to endure a…"

The Park Chennai,Tardy rooms,2,"The Park is one of the preferred hotels on our company's internal travel portal and hence i had no hesitation in booking this hotel for our stay in Chennai. We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again. To start off the upholstery on the  sofa in the room was worn out, the shower head in the bathroom had rust stains all over them. The hotel room itself was dull and unispiring.

Right From the reception you get the impression that there is going to be a hiccup with the way you are treated.

The location is great, food is top notch just a change in the attitude of the management and minor tweaks in the room will make this hotel a good stay.…"

Its is minimum courtesy to inform weather you have upgraded us or not, Its not at all professional to inform us we were upgraded and not being done in fact. We did wait 10 mins for them to process the upgrade which was never done. The Breakfast resturant is way overcrowded for the 580 odd rooms they have and the tables are way too small to hold the big plates and there is a long delay for the staff to clear the plates, You have to go reming the live counter staff twice to give you your order…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Overpriced, overrated",2,"We had unfortunately stayed in this hotel for a couple of days in November and later in the week at Hotel Savera, Mylapore which provided me with an apt comparison of facilities at both hotels. The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale.

Really bad seating position for work on a laptop. •	Safe was not working and had to get new batteries. Should have been checked or changed beforehand. •	There is a torch in the room, which is good to have. But it was not working and had to be replaced. This should have been checked beforehand. •	Fruit was delivered to my room, three apples, after I have checked in and not prior to my arrival, that is strange and was unnecessary disturbing when I was working.

Missing French press spoiled my mood to have my important cup of coffee. When you reach at 11 in the night and you know the hotel is a small maze, you expect someone to guide you towards your room.

Only if you are a Hilton Honours member and ONLY of you make a booking directly with them do you qualify for free wifi else NOFI. If you choose a plan it is a whopping Rs 800 per 24 hours. In the 80's a Justice of the Indian courts coined a term ""DIABOLICAL PROFITEERING""  that is what Hilton in India is doing.

At that point they refused to accept my card !!! They stood like zombies and wasted my precious 15 minutes while they checked their records !!! got delayed for my next appointment.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Bad Service and a Mediocre Business Hotel,2,"Well Chennai --- as a place for any non tamil speaking person be it Indian or a foreign national is always tough. I generally used to say in Radha Regent, Pride or Taj Clubhouse but for the last 3 times since i had work in porur - i decided to stay in this place. One thing which was aptly clear to me is that the place can barely offer bed and breakfast and nothing else. The housekeeping is just average and a lot of energy is wasted in telling and yelling as to how one wants and why one wants it? Two of the pretty most integral questions one keeps on asking. The TV will not have HDMI cords - The washroom will not have hand towels etc. The rooms are contemporary and the design is chic.

Despite the hotel promoting itself as a premier five star property I had a disappointing experience.  Issues:- 1. Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile.

The dosas were boring, even the podi dosa that is so famous in chennai. Buffet spread is decent, but i would expect a lot better taste for the price i paid.  Service:  Front desk…"
The Park Chennai,Not the best..,2,"Stayed at a suite for two days at this hotel. While check in was fairly smooth, this hotel certainly doesn't have the quality of a 5 star hotel that it claims to be. The hotel appears quite dated, both at the reception as well as in the rooms.  The location of the hotel is great if you're coming to get your US visa.  The carpets in the room was stained and so was the floor. The sink in the bathroom was completely blocked and required me to call someone in to fix it. I wonder why hotels don't get these things done themselves when the room is serviced? Why does it require a guest to call in?  Even though this was a suite, there was no hairdryer available and it had to be requested for. (Took 40 mins and 2 calls to arrive)  Reception did not give me a 2nd key card because they had…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Over-charging!,2,"I had to stopover in Chennai and based on its location (close to the airport) and Trip Advisor reviews, I chose Raidisson Blu. This is a rather blend business hotel but with efficient service. However the below incident marred it all.  Upon check-in, we had been ""upgraded"" as the hotel was running full on standard double rooms. However, upon check-out, I was grossly over-charged (by 8% extra) as the hotel staff claimed that the service tax must be applied on the non-discounted rate (ie the rate of the higher-category room). I wasn't informed by the staff upfront, I noticed the problem myself (unfortunately after paying) and when I pointed to the discrepancy with my confirmation slip (from Blu Radisson website), the hotel staff refused to buldge and annoyingly referred to the…"
The Park Chennai,Chennai Business Trip,2,I stayed here for one day but i dint like this hotel. May b my expectations were high as i stay in Park frequently across country. The moment i enter i felt that coz the door is not proper. Lobby was not cleaned. TV kept in room was also smaller one and that too kept in a corner.  Remote was not working ..when asked for correction i had to call them 4 times to get it done. breakfast was also not good..not much variety.…

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",They snoop through private belongings,2,"The hotel is beautiful.   But the maids look through your belongings:  I had written a list of small things that needed improvements in the room, small details such as the fact that toiletries were for men, lights that didn't switch off in the bathroom, and a leaky faucet.  Really not much. I wrote the list of repairs as well as personal thoughts in pencil on a pad provided by the hotel and left it on the desk among tons of other business papers.  When we got back, two maids and the head of housekeeping were in our room, apologizing that the service wasn't perfect.  When I asked how they knew about my small complaints, they said they had read my note.  THEY READ MY PRIVATE NOTE.  And they were very proud that they had been proactive.  Adding insult to injury, we had to endure a…"

Hilton Chennai,Dodgy and poorly located,2,"OK I was put up here by a company. On arrival first thing they wanted was a Rs 5000/- charge on my card.  Then I realised that while Intercontinental Hotel Group, IBIS, Taj Hotels, Marriott you name it they all give you free wifi, NOT Hilton, no no no. Only if you are a Hilton Honours member and ONLY of you make a booking directly with them do you qualify for free wifi else NOFI. If you choose a plan it is a whopping Rs 800 per 24 hours. In the 80's a Justice of the Indian courts coined a term ""DIABOLICAL PROFITEERING""  that is what Hilton in India is doing.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not for the light sleeper,2,"The central atrium looks impressive, but actually acts as an echo chamber which amplifies the noise from the reception area. That is bad enough, but when they have music playing loudly until 2am, people chatting noisily until 3am, and then the cleaning and vacuuming starting it makes for a very disturbed night.  The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable). Unless you have a meeting in the hotel or very…"

There are no quiet bars, the restaurant food and service is average and the rooms (bathrooms in particular ) are not the cleanest.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Overpriced, overrated",2,"We had unfortunately stayed in this hotel for a couple of days in November and later in the week at Hotel Savera, Mylapore which provided me with an apt comparison of facilities at both hotels. The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale. Only when we had pointed this out they were replaced. Parking…"

Sent them email a month ago prior to our stay.  No reply from them.  Made the effort to call them directly from overseas,  spoke to Duty Manager Ayushi,  she said will take note of my requests. During check in,  hotel receptionist said no indication of any requests.  End up change of room on our 1st day stay at night after we back from day tour, we were tired!!  Look at how ignorant the hotel Management is, even the duty Manager Ayushi!! She is not an asset to the hotel. The room was okay expect there was a bad smell from the toilet as i think got some sewage issue. I check out after 3 days, its was my wife's birthday,  the hotel screwed…"

I have stayed in Taj Lake Palace , umed Bhawan palace, Taj Exotica Goa, Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai , Taj Man singh delhi in last one year but this hotel just sucks...  Three times my rooms changed due to poor housekeeping issue finally they upgrade me to suite . The housekeeping needs improvement . Despite noted at the time of booking  no toiletries for kids.

The Park Chennai,5 star for a caveman..... maybe.,2,"We recently had a 2 night visit to The Park. The hotel is definitely not the 5 stars it rates itself to be and maybe the management need to visit real 5 star properties and re-evaluate themselves. I rate The Park 3.5 stars (at best).  The entrance is very bland and like no other hotel I have been to. Just a huge wall with big wooden door. No signage or anything to indicate you are at a hotel.  The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.   Like others have mentioned, this hotel is very run down and in urgent need of attention. The rooms have a strange smell and the finishing touches like painting and joinery are of a poor standard. It seems that not a lot of thought went into water run off in the…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.  I stayed at the Raddison hotel, booked through Orbitz.  The Raddison was not cheap, well over 5,000 Rupees for a few hours of stay! I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble. I guess I can live with the exhorbitant price…"

The Park Chennai,a blemish to my great Indian trip,2,"i have been hopping between cities in India for the past week and i must say that my stay at the Park Hotel in Chennai was the low point for my trip.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…

The service right from the check-in formalities it's terrible. They make you wait for almost 15-20 mins, the desk staff are on calls and just don't even excuse themselves before they leave, they would keep you waiting. They have coupon for lunch and dinner, which isn't rightly given. There is clearly no coordination between different departments. We had lunch at Cafe Mercara, the staff there are very rude and strange, even after repeating the order, they will miss out on some food items, you need to ask them for basic things like water, it's like reminding them their own duties. We had asked for some extra bowl of rice, they just dint show up and completely ignored the order even after requesting them twice. We…"

This is my experience the first day and the first few hours at Hilton Chennai in November 2013: •	Too low office chair for the work desk in the room. Really bad seating position for work on a laptop. •	Safe was not working and had to get new batteries. Should have been checked or changed beforehand. •	There is a torch in the room, which is good to have. But it was not working and had to be replaced. This should have been checked beforehand. •	Fruit was delivered to my room, three apples, after I have checked in and not prior to my arrival, that is strange and was unnecessary disturbing when I was working.

The Park Chennai,Tardy rooms,2,"The Park is one of the preferred hotels on our company's internal travel portal and hence i had no hesitation in booking this hotel for our stay in Chennai. We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again. To start off the upholstery on the  sofa in the room was worn out, the shower head in the bathroom had rust stains all over them. The hotel room itself was dull and unispiring. It seems to me that the hotel has neglected the maintenance in the rooms and the rooms were a…"

But this was the smallest car pick up I have ever had. An old Honda city. I was like ok.

Despite the hotel promoting itself as a premier five star property I had a disappointing experience.  Issues:- 1. Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile. Though there are welcome drinks kept inside a cabinet, I never them offering them to anyone. 3.The rooms are dark, stinky with no approach to…"

Taj Club House,"It's not a Taj Standard .........,",2,"I am Taj fan. But this hotel, sucks...would suggest don't stay in this hotel. I believe this property has forgotten the word ""maintenance"". I have stayed 1st times in this property And disappointed.  I was surprised...how one Taj property can be like this. This was my first and worst experience in any Taj property. I have stayed in Taj Lake Palace , umed Bhawan palace, Taj Exotica Goa, Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai , Taj Man singh delhi in last one year but this hotel just sucks...

GreenPark Chennai,Poor attention to detail,2,"We went in August and stayed for  a week and myself and my two children were looking forward to a dip in the swimming pool every day to escape the Chennai heat - Alas, the pool was closed for maintenance !! - without any no prior notification!!!. A five star hotel expecting foreign visitors should not close its swimming pool for maintenace during the peak holiday season (ie, school holiday period in the US, UK, Europe and Canada, when a lot of foreign tourists visit India). Can the yearly maintenance not be carried out in March? Also, twice (Sundays on both occasions), I saw people vomitting near the barbecue by the swimming pool - they were high on alcohol. Looked like they were locals attending one of the parties in the many function rooms in the Hotel. Too many of the people…"
The Park Chennai,The Park doesn't deserve 5 STAR status,2,"I had to stay in The Park recently for 4 nights for my VISA interview, and I have booked ""Luxury"" room with 1 Queen Bed for my stay.   I arrived around 9:30 PM, and the reservation desk took a while (around 10 - 15mins) to get the room ready. Moreover, the hotel staffs at the reservation desk were multitasking, keeping me waited at the counter itself. This itself didn't give me a good impression on the reception. The receptionist just gave the room key without informing me anything about where the breakfast will be served / do I have any luggage to be carried to the room. I had to remind them about my luggage to be carried to my room. They gave me a room in the second floor.  1.

Check-in: There was about 4-5pax at reception, of which i think about 3 are trainees who was helping the 2main check in guy to photocopy passport and just stand around watching people. There were 3 group of pax checking in at that time, 1 in midst of check in, myself and another grp of 3pax who was trying to check in. While waiting to be served, I can immediately noticed the unhappy faces from all the 2 main check in staff at the desk.

However, you will be surprised to see the crowd here as they come unusually in larger numbers. Most of the guest stay here for its strategic location which is very near to American consulate. Staying one night for Visa purpose in a so-so hotel doesn't hurt unless you care about your own money which you might have paid for this stay (Most people don't as there stay will be borne by their company). For super expensive food, smelly lobby, unmaintained  floors and very average buffet - I can't rate it more than 2 stars.…"

The Park Chennai,Most of the rooms are old and bad. Has a few good rooms which the management seems very reluctant to give.,2,"We stayed here for two nights in February for our visa appointment. We reached the hotel at around 9pm and were pretty shocked with the kind of room they provided us with - old, musty and visibly dirty. The bathroom had paan stains all over, the shower curtains were old and dirty (looks like they weren't washed for years). We called the reception and asked for a change of room, and they moved us to another room that was like 10 times worse than the first. This is the first time we've seen a hotel management moving it's guest to a worse room when being asked for a room change. We asked for another change and they just kept showing us similar bad, worse to worst rooms. Finally we decided to walk out of the hotel,  when we noticed two floors (as the lift stopped at them) seemed to…"

I am spending numerous weeks in Chennai and would not have been comfortable in this hotel for more than one or two nights...

Issues from my point of view:  thin hard mattress; only bed covering is sheet and light cotton spread; two lumpy pillows on the bed; all floors a marble - very cold/hard; smokey smell in the room - called front desk - they told me there are NO non-smoking rooms - woke up in the middle of the night to smoke smell from people in near by rooms; two pieces of…

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Disappointing - definitely unsuitable for tourists,2,"As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby at around 10pm on a Friday night, I felt disappointed.  The hotel's website had indeed exaggerated the size and grandeur of the lobby, and it was filled with noise and people. The seating in the lounge area had lost its springs many moons ago.  Over two nights I came to realize that the hotel is overpriced and in need of renovation.  The corridors are dowdy and our room, though with a modern bathroom, was a gloomy mish mash of dark furniture and seating.  The crowded breakfast area is indeed in need of renovation - with scratched fittings and sagging chairs. We sought refuge in the Radisson Club, but this was claustrophobic and noisy.  An important point is that this is definitely not a hotel suitable for tourists. It's close to the…"

They have coupon for lunch and dinner, which isn't rightly given. There is clearly no coordination between different departments. We had lunch at Cafe Mercara, the staff there are very rude and strange, even after repeating the order, they will miss out on some food items, you need to ask them for basic things like water, it's like reminding them their own duties. We had asked for some extra bowl of rice, they just dint show up and completely ignored the order even after requesting them twice. We…"

The furniture is all chipped, wires dangling and lights fused. The daily house keeping trolley is similar to a wooden trolley what beggars pull on the roads. Shampoo, bath gel and laundry bags/sheets are not replenished everyday. The house keeping staff go on all fours to swab the floor. The music from the leather bar can be heard in the rooms at night.Hot water was not available on many days and the answer given was that there was an air lock..... not convincing.However food at the buffet restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and…"

First, the room we were given had a distinct odour, which we realized came from used wet clothes in the bathroom.

Now, when in the new room, i saw all toiletries missing, and asked for housekeeping. The housekeeping guy is asking me what all I need- isn't a bath towel, a face towel, soap and dental kit a normal thing? I had to spell out the details.  Food: Average is the word.

To make a long story short: We were shown 11 rooms in total. My friends, who are sensitive to odors, decided to find another hotel to stay in. I settled for the least offensive room and stayed for 3 nights. Just came back home and when I opened my suitcase, the mustly odor had traveled back home with me in my clothes.

Really bad seating position for work on a laptop. •	Safe was not working and had to get new batteries.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Disappointing - definitely unsuitable for tourists,2,"As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby at around 10pm on a Friday night, I felt disappointed.  The hotel's website had indeed exaggerated the size and grandeur of the lobby, and it was filled with noise and people. The seating in the lounge area had lost its springs many moons ago.  Over two nights I came to realize that the hotel is overpriced and in need of renovation.  The corridors are dowdy and our room, though with a modern bathroom, was a gloomy mish mash of dark furniture and seating.  The crowded breakfast area is indeed in need of renovation - with scratched fittings and sagging chairs. We sought refuge in the Radisson Club, but this was claustrophobic and noisy.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Overpriced, overrated",2,"We had unfortunately stayed in this hotel for a couple of days in November and later in the week at Hotel Savera, Mylapore which provided me with an apt comparison of facilities at both hotels. The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale. Only when we had pointed this out they were replaced. Parking…"
GreenPark Chennai,Poor attention to detail,2,"We went in August and stayed for  a week and myself and my two children were looking forward to a dip in the swimming pool every day to escape the Chennai heat - Alas, the pool was closed for maintenance !! - without any no prior notification!!!. A five star hotel expecting foreign visitors should not close its swimming pool for maintenace during the peak holiday season (ie, school holiday period in the US, UK, Europe and Canada, when a lot of foreign tourists visit India). Can the yearly maintenance not be carried out in March? Also, twice (Sundays on both occasions), I saw people vomitting near the barbecue by the swimming pool - they were high on alcohol. Looked like they were locals attending one of the parties in the many function rooms in the Hotel. Too many of the people…"

Nothing was good about my stay. First, the rooms were to congested and small. Too many unnecessary things such as the tables & decorative stuffs. And then the toilet, the furniture were worn out and uncomfortable. Then, it took almost 1 hour for them to send the food that I ordered from room service. The staffs were not giving enough to information when a question is asked. Also, the staff which a guy from the travel desk was rude when I asked some questions. And the worst incident was when I found a HALF EATEN APPLE under the study desk. It was terrible. The price was just too expensive for the stay and not worth it at all.

Privacy is something very important that is not met in this hotel, cleaners who enter the room without calling and a vigilance by the staff of the hotel that comes to take pictures of personal belongings, fact that is proven. The manager of the hotel does not respond to the height of a hotel of its characteristics, remaining in evidence in situations that have made us feel very uncomfortable with their treatment. the cleanliness in some parts of the hotel is not as expected in European hotels, creating the perfect conditions for mosquitoes in bathrooms for example.  the bathrooms of the rooms are not cleaned properly every day, as well as…"

We reached the hotel at around 9pm and were pretty shocked with the kind of room they provided us with - old, musty and visibly dirty. The bathroom had paan stains all over, the shower curtains were old and dirty (looks like they weren't washed for years). We called the reception and asked for a change of room, and they moved us to another room that was like 10 times worse than the first. This is the first time we've seen a hotel management moving it's guest to a worse room when being asked for a room change. We asked for another change and they just kept showing us similar bad, worse to worst rooms.

The Park Chennai,Not fit to be a 5 star. Basic facilities compromised,2,"Being in India you expect hotels to have water for washing up in the WC. Well, this hotel thinks it is located in a European district with only toilet paper.  That's not all. The hotel & room services are very disappointing given the fact Park is a known chain in India. The room has no glasses to drink water. So you use the cans and bottles as it is. There is no iron in the room considering this is a popular business hotel.   How do I even start on a good thing about the hotel except for a very polite front office staff.   There are no electric points near the bed in reach. The one point near the bed is below the side table and not accessible unless you get down on your knees and have a long arm like mine.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Stix (chinese restaurant) sucks!,2,"This review is in specific for the Chinese Restaurant. I have never stayed at the hotel, and hoping im reviewing in the right spot! The restaurant has some of the worst ventilation I have ever come across, even in a 3 star hotel. Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze. Since more than 50% of the seats seemed to be near the open kitchen, I was a little surprised by the wait staff assuring us they could have given us a better table near the lobby, which was now full.  The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"
GreenPark Chennai,Disappointing for a business traveler,2,I came to Chennai for business - and this hotel was recommended due to it's proximity to the Company I was working with.  I was very disappointed - and actually checked out and moved to another hotel after 2 days.  I am spending numerous weeks in Chennai and would not have been comfortable in this hotel for more than one or two nights...  My overall experience would be better stated as barely OKAY with lots of issues...  Issues from my point of view:  thin hard mattress; only bed covering is sheet and light cotton spread; two lumpy pillows on the bed; all floors a marble - very cold/hard; smokey smell in the room - called front desk - they told me there are NO non-smoking rooms - woke up in the middle of the night to smoke smell from people in near by rooms; two pieces of…
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…
The Park Chennai,5 star for a caveman..... maybe.,2,"We recently had a 2 night visit to The Park. The hotel is definitely not the 5 stars it rates itself to be and maybe the management need to visit real 5 star properties and re-evaluate themselves. I rate The Park 3.5 stars (at best).  The entrance is very bland and like no other hotel I have been to. Just a huge wall with big wooden door. No signage or anything to indicate you are at a hotel.  The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.   Like others have mentioned, this hotel is very run down and in urgent need of attention. The rooms have a strange smell and the finishing touches like painting and joinery are of a poor standard. It seems that not a lot of thought went into water run off in the…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Bad Service and a Mediocre Business Hotel,2,"Well Chennai --- as a place for any non tamil speaking person be it Indian or a foreign national is always tough. I generally used to say in Radha Regent, Pride or Taj Clubhouse but for the last 3 times since i had work in porur - i decided to stay in this place. One thing which was aptly clear to me is that the place can barely offer bed and breakfast and nothing else. The housekeeping is just average and a lot of energy is wasted in telling and yelling as to how one wants and why one wants it? Two of the pretty most integral questions one keeps on asking. The TV will not have HDMI cords - The washroom will not have hand towels etc. The rooms are contemporary and the design is chic.

Staying one night for Visa purpose in a so-so hotel doesn't hurt unless you care about your own money which you might have paid for this stay (Most people don't as there stay will be borne by their company). For super expensive food, smelly lobby, unmaintained  floors and very average buffet - I can't rate it more than 2 stars.…"

The Park Chennai,Not the best..,2,"Stayed at a suite for two days at this hotel. While check in was fairly smooth, this hotel certainly doesn't have the quality of a 5 star hotel that it claims to be. The hotel appears quite dated, both at the reception as well as in the rooms.  The location of the hotel is great if you're coming to get your US visa.  The carpets in the room was stained and so was the floor. The sink in the bathroom was completely blocked and required me to call someone in to fix it. I wonder why hotels don't get these things done themselves when the room is serviced? Why does it require a guest to call in?  Even though this was a suite, there was no hairdryer available and it had to be requested for. (Took 40 mins and 2 calls to arrive)  Reception did not give me a 2nd key card because they had…"

The Park Chennai,Don’t expect to sleep. ,2,"The Park’s lobby is a wonderful example of flashy design winning out over functionality and guest convenience. The furniture in the lobby is perversely uncomfortable.   The restaurant and bar open off the large reception atrium space. The bar hosts a variety of events which involve loud music. Both the nights I stayed the music was blaring out until past 3am and, as the rooms are off the atrium, I got very little sleep.   The rooms are a little more standard in terms of design. The upper floors have a halfhearted sort of Indian Cinema theme with old cinema posters and images of various film stars. I found the bed large but quite soft. Wardrobe hanging space was limited. A lot of the furnishings were a little tired. There are very few electrical sockets and some located very…"

The rooms are spacious and the staff courteous, but that is about all the good I can say.  The rooms seem to be recently renovated, where corners have been cut. Certain things seem old.  The bathroom was the major woe. The towels stank... reeked of stale odor. The toothbrush provided had the hardest bristles I have ever experienced. The razor and shaving cream were of the cheapest available brand. For the money you pay, all this is just unacceptable.  The ironing board provided is very small.  I asked for some extra dairy whiteners at 8.40pm, and I was told that they won't be available before morning as the dept was closed. 8.40 isn't even that late!

We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. They were throughout our stay very courteous and hospitable.   It made our stay bearable. The rooms are dated, bathroom was dingy and poorly lit. Walls had stains, don't know of what. The main floors are wood and showed its age. Paint in the corners of the room were peeling and looked like the windows haven't been washed for over a decade. We could hear hammering and masonry work from another floor between 10am to about 2pm most days. Not helpful, when you're jet lagged.   The Room Service (food) was tasty but extremely pricey. About 30% in taxes are added on top of the menu price. Compared to US prices,…"
The Park Chennai,Terrible check-in experience,2,"Arrived 23Oct about 11pm+ after a long flight and all i need was a quick check in and a room so I can get some sleep. Pickup from airport was smooth, but the moment i reached the hotel, the ordeal began.   Check-in: There was about 4-5pax at reception, of which i think about 3 are trainees who was helping the 2main check in guy to photocopy passport and just stand around watching people. There were 3 group of pax checking in at that time, 1 in midst of check in, myself and another grp of 3pax who was trying to check in. While waiting to be served, I can immediately noticed the unhappy faces from all the 2 main check in staff at the desk. As we are all being ignored pretty much, we had to brace the frown and tried to get the guys’ attention to help us chck in. After some waiting,…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Worst group lunch @Madras pavilion restaurant, not recommended.",2,"Been to a team lunch @ Madras Pavailion restaurant.   The ambience of the hotel and the restaurant was great, but the seating, food and service was very poor.   They arranged seating for 100+ people in 3 tables, so it was terrible. Staff treated our team like cattle. One lady staff in the restaurant desk asked me ""if I am with all 'these people'?"" Apparenlty, she wanted to stop me from sitting in any other (properly arranged) table.  Worst language and service I had seen in any hotel in this category.  The spread was big, many starters, main courses and desserts. But the place was very crowded and it was hard to find the right food. The spread was too widespread. Very few service personnel was there to help and the food quality was below average - except few items like Kozhi…"

Possible cause cooked and kept for long time , since very low guest turnout Until then we were quiet well engrossed in the time we we where spending together  Mr Surya the chef of the hotel came over , should be cause he would have been appraised, but with the attitude which really spoiled the evening, it is upto the Chef to accept the feedback or to reject, which too was made in…"
The Park Chennai,Dirty room and bathroom ,2, I had stayed with this  hotel on 26-04-17 and check out on 27-04-17. I want to say that my stay was really bad as I found the room and toilet very dirty the paint was chipped on the room wall and over all the room was really dirty. I chose this  hotel seeing the rating on trip advisor and also on booking.com but am sorry to say this hotel was rated 5 star on booking.com but I did not feel a single thing 5 star about the hotel. The hotel needs a huge renovation over all. The walk way from lift to room was very bad it felt as if I was in a lodge.really embarrassed to stay with this hotel. Not worth the money.…

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Below Average,2,"What would you feel, if you land at the hotel in midnight and find the frond desk and lobby deserted?  Landed late night at  Chennai, reached hotel at midnight found the lobby deserted, no one at the reception to receive.  I requested for a King Size Non Smoking room on higher floor. Reiterated it to the fron desk executive twice, and to my surprise, I was give a claustrophobic, queen bed 8x8 room. The front desk executive didn't even bother to inform me.   Horrible and pathetic service.  Food is average, I tried dessert, couldn't differentiate whether it was ""Carrot Kheer"" or sugar syrup.

Moreover, the hotel staffs at the reservation desk were multitasking, keeping me waited at the counter itself. This itself didn't give me a good impression on the reception. The receptionist just gave the room key without informing me anything about where the breakfast will be served / do I have any luggage to be carried to the room. I had to remind them about my luggage to be carried to my room. They gave me a room in the second floor.  1.

The taxi could not locate the hotel, so i tried to call them , but the taped message said the line has been disconnected, then i called up the booking website , they also got the same message, then i opened the laptop and located the hotel on the net . After that i reached the hotel. The hotel said , they can provide the room after 10.30 , though the booking was from that day , with a request for early check in at 6. I had to pay for a half day extra. This was unlike any other hotel, if the rooms are empty , they allow the guest to check in . Being a new hotel , the rooms are well done , the property is well designed. the breakfast is decent. the staff at the restaurant gave very good service.…"
The Park Chennai,a blemish to my great Indian trip,2,"i have been hopping between cities in India for the past week and i must say that my stay at the Park Hotel in Chennai was the low point for my trip. The hotel needs a serious renovation, it stinks, floors are squeaky, the night club opposite the reception area is such a shocker - basically now that i have stayed there i will discourage any of my friends and people i know never to ever consider it if they ever find themselves in Chennai.  I do believe that the Park Hotel brand can do something to rehabilitate this hotel.…"
The Park Chennai,Not fit to be a 5 star. Basic facilities compromised,2,"Being in India you expect hotels to have water for washing up in the WC. Well, this hotel thinks it is located in a European district with only toilet paper.  That's not all. The hotel & room services are very disappointing given the fact Park is a known chain in India. The room has no glasses to drink water. So you use the cans and bottles as it is. There is no iron in the room considering this is a popular business hotel.   How do I even start on a good thing about the hotel except for a very polite front office staff.   There are no electric points near the bed in reach. The one point near the bed is below the side table and not accessible unless you get down on your knees and have a long arm like mine. Better to use the table switches to charge your phone's in the night. …"

This is my experience the first day and the first few hours at Hilton Chennai in November 2013: •	Too low office chair for the work desk in the room. Really bad seating position for work on a laptop. •	Safe was not working and had to get new batteries. Should have been checked or changed beforehand. •	There is a torch in the room, which is good to have. But it was not working and had to be replaced. This should have been checked beforehand. •	Fruit was delivered to my room, three apples, after I have checked in and not prior to my arrival, that is strange and was unnecessary disturbing when I was working.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Upgrade I did not want ,2,"Upgraded to a two bedroom apartment with small rooms. I had booked a room that allows me to have night sleep, large apartment is tough to manage. Too many power points to make it dark to get some sleep. Missing French press spoiled my mood to have my important cup of coffee. When you reach at 11 in the night and you know the hotel is a small maze, you expect someone to guide you towards your room.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Bad experience for the money you pay and for the brand you chose.,2,"It takes a few flash decision to ruin your entire vacation and that happened when we opted for Lemon tree, Chennai for a stay while returning from Pondicherry. We made the booking through make my trip however things turned upside down after reaching the hotel.   - The reception keeps over selling the plans (breakfast, airport drop, dinner...etc) even after saying a clear ""NO"". A big turn off. - The booking was made for a couple. The hotel room initially offered to us had two separate beds, we were asked to pay 1300 Rs extra if we wish to take a king size bed else no other rooms were available (Nice trick). They termed it as executive room up-gradation with inclusion of dinner for two members. After up-gradation we found the room to be exactly the same except a joint bed.  -…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Bad Service and a Mediocre Business Hotel,2,"Well Chennai --- as a place for any non tamil speaking person be it Indian or a foreign national is always tough. I generally used to say in Radha Regent, Pride or Taj Clubhouse but for the last 3 times since i had work in porur - i decided to stay in this place. One thing which was aptly clear to me is that the place can barely offer bed and breakfast and nothing else. The housekeeping is just average and a lot of energy is wasted in telling and yelling as to how one wants and why one wants it? Two of the pretty most integral questions one keeps on asking. The TV will not have HDMI cords - The washroom will not have hand towels etc. The rooms are contemporary and the design is chic.  The AC noise in my rooms both times was deafening so please check this before you take the…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.  I stayed at the Raddison hotel, booked through Orbitz.  The Raddison was not cheap, well over 5,000 Rupees for a few hours of stay! I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble. I guess I can live with the exhorbitant price…"

But this was the smallest car pick up I have ever had. An old Honda city. I was like ok. Any quad nearby so why worry  2) when u reached the hotel there where like buses and vans on the porch with hundreds of people. It seems it was some office function which got over. So no one was there to great me who was a guest staying in the hotel.…"
The Park Chennai,parking Mad,2,"This was an expensive but vastly overrated hotel. The staff were largely unprofessional (except for the Club suite), the rooms initially were grubby and smelly and I had to move 3 times in 2 days due to the poor conditions. The rooms did not have some basic items and I threatened to leave before being offered a salvage deal in the Club suite which was the only area approaching anywhere near 5 star standard during my whole time there. I would not advise anyone to stay here except in the Club section if you want anything above basic 3 star. The food however was acceptable and the spa was good but expensive.…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good looking property. Just couldn't find a room that didn't have a strong musty odor,2,"Arriving for a 3 night stay last week, myself and a couple of friends we admired the beautiful lobby and were pleased with the restaurant selection located right on the property. Things didn't go so well after we opened the doors to our rooms. A strong, musty odor greeted us. The bathrooms hat water stains and white mold growing on the wall. To make a long story short: We were shown 11 rooms in total. My friends, who are sensitive to odors, decided to find another hotel to stay in. I settled for the least offensive room and stayed for 3 nights. Just came back home and when I opened my suitcase, the mustly odor had traveled back home with me in my clothes.  It's really a shame, because the staff is so very nice and tried to accommodate us. We actually felt bad for them, but what…"

A five star hotel expecting foreign visitors should not close its swimming pool for maintenace during the peak holiday season (ie, school holiday period in the US, UK, Europe and Canada, when a lot of foreign tourists visit India). Can the yearly maintenance not be carried out in March? Also, twice (Sundays on both occasions), I saw people vomitting near the barbecue by the swimming pool - they were high on alcohol.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Overpriced, overrated",2,"We had unfortunately stayed in this hotel for a couple of days in November and later in the week at Hotel Savera, Mylapore which provided me with an apt comparison of facilities at both hotels. The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale.

We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again. To start off the upholstery on the  sofa in the room was worn out, the shower head in the bathroom had rust stains all over them. The hotel room itself was dull and unispiring.

The furniture is all chipped, wires dangling and lights fused. The daily house keeping trolley is similar to a wooden trolley what beggars pull on the roads. Shampoo, bath gel and laundry bags/sheets are not replenished everyday. The house keeping staff go on all fours to swab the floor. The music from the leather bar can be heard in the rooms at night.Hot water was not available on many days and the answer given was that there was an air lock..... not convincing.However food at the buffet restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",They snoop through private belongings,2,"The hotel is beautiful.   But the maids look through your belongings:  I had written a list of small things that needed improvements in the room, small details such as the fact that toiletries were for men, lights that didn't switch off in the bathroom, and a leaky faucet.  Really not much. I wrote the list of repairs as well as personal thoughts in pencil on a pad provided by the hotel and left it on the desk among tons of other business papers.  When we got back, two maids and the head of housekeeping were in our room, apologizing that the service wasn't perfect.  When I asked how they knew about my small complaints, they said they had read my note.  THEY READ MY PRIVATE NOTE.  And they were very proud that they had been proactive.  Adding insult to injury, we had to endure a…"

GreenPark Chennai,does not meet the conditions of a 4-star hotel,2,"It is a hotel where there are continually conventions and weddings which create a noisy atmosphere that sometimes makes it difficult to sleep. Privacy is something very important that is not met in this hotel, cleaners who enter the room without calling and a vigilance by the staff of the hotel that comes to take pictures of personal belongings, fact that is proven. The manager of the hotel does not respond to the height of a hotel of its characteristics, remaining in evidence in situations that have made us feel very uncomfortable with their treatment. the cleanliness in some parts of the hotel is not as expected in European hotels, creating the perfect conditions for mosquitoes in bathrooms for example.  the bathrooms of the rooms are not cleaned properly every day, as well as…"

The bathroom was the major woe. The towels stank... reeked of stale odor. The toothbrush provided had the hardest bristles I have ever experienced. The razor and shaving cream were of the cheapest available brand. For the money you pay, all this is just unacceptable.  The ironing board provided is very small.

GreenPark Chennai,Poor attention to detail,2,"We went in August and stayed for  a week and myself and my two children were looking forward to a dip in the swimming pool every day to escape the Chennai heat - Alas, the pool was closed for maintenance !! - without any no prior notification!!!. A five star hotel expecting foreign visitors should not close its swimming pool for maintenace during the peak holiday season (ie, school holiday period in the US, UK, Europe and Canada, when a lot of foreign tourists visit India). Can the yearly maintenance not be carried out in March? Also, twice (Sundays on both occasions), I saw people vomitting near the barbecue by the swimming pool - they were high on alcohol. Looked like they were locals attending one of the parties in the many function rooms in the Hotel. Too many of the people…"

The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable).

During check in,  hotel receptionist said no indication of any requests.  End up change of room on our 1st day stay at night after we back from day tour, we were tired!!  Look at how ignorant the hotel Management is, even the duty Manager Ayushi!! She is not an asset to the hotel.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Stix (chinese restaurant) sucks!,2,"This review is in specific for the Chinese Restaurant. I have never stayed at the hotel, and hoping im reviewing in the right spot! The restaurant has some of the worst ventilation I have ever come across, even in a 3 star hotel. Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze. Since more than 50% of the seats seemed to be near the open kitchen, I was a little surprised by the wait staff assuring us they could have given us a better table near the lobby, which was now full.  The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Poorly trained staff and there are other lot better choices for money.,2,"I guess they really wanted to make money at expense of gullible travelers.

Everyone seems to be nervous but they don't know what needs to be done. Restaurant service slow and unreliable. Property seems nicely built but finishes are no way close to other luxury properties we have been.  Would recommend after year or more till they things right and a real bar. One work I heard a lot around the property was "" I apologize"" and that's never a good sign.…"

The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.

When we reached the hotel, we were asked to provide id cards. My husband provided his.I wasn't carrying one as we got out locked out of the house with just my husband's wallet (thankful for at least that!) We tried explaining this situation to the manager who was refusing to give us the room with out my ID card.They claimed that this clause was mentioned in the confirmation mail.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Disappointing - definitely unsuitable for tourists,2,"As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby at around 10pm on a Friday night, I felt disappointed.  The hotel's website had indeed exaggerated the size and grandeur of the lobby, and it was filled with noise and people. The seating in the lounge area had lost its springs many moons ago.  Over two nights I came to realize that the hotel is overpriced and in need of renovation.  The corridors are dowdy and our room, though with a modern bathroom, was a gloomy mish mash of dark furniture and seating.  The crowded breakfast area is indeed in need of renovation - with scratched fittings and sagging chairs. We sought refuge in the Radisson Club, but this was claustrophobic and noisy.  An important point is that this is definitely not a hotel suitable for tourists. It's close to the…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Overpriced & not worth it,2,"I booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights with family because I was looking for a hotel nearby the airport. Nothing was good about my stay. First, the rooms were to congested and small. Too many unnecessary things such as the tables & decorative stuffs. And then the toilet, the furniture were worn out and uncomfortable. Then, it took almost 1 hour for them to send the food that I ordered from room service. The staffs were not giving enough to information when a question is asked. Also, the staff which a guy from the travel desk was rude when I asked some questions. And the worst incident was when I found a HALF EATEN APPLE under the study desk. It was terrible. The price was just too expensive for the stay and not worth it at all. I used to stay in The Hilton chennai, and…"
The Park Chennai,Don’t expect to sleep. ,2,"The Park’s lobby is a wonderful example of flashy design winning out over functionality and guest convenience. The furniture in the lobby is perversely uncomfortable.   The restaurant and bar open off the large reception atrium space. The bar hosts a variety of events which involve loud music. Both the nights I stayed the music was blaring out until past 3am and, as the rooms are off the atrium, I got very little sleep.   The rooms are a little more standard in terms of design. The upper floors have a halfhearted sort of Indian Cinema theme with old cinema posters and images of various film stars. I found the bed large but quite soft. Wardrobe hanging space was limited. A lot of the furnishings were a little tired. There are very few electrical sockets and some located very…"

The Park Chennai,Not up to the mark!,2,"Bad Experience! I stayed at room no 7025 of  the hotel from 15th to 19th of August 2018. Despite the hotel promoting itself as a premier five star property I had a disappointing experience.  Issues:- 1. Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile. Though there are welcome drinks kept inside a cabinet, I never them offering them to anyone. 3.The rooms are dark, stinky with no approach to…"

On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard.

The Park Chennai,Not the best..,2,"Stayed at a suite for two days at this hotel. While check in was fairly smooth, this hotel certainly doesn't have the quality of a 5 star hotel that it claims to be. The hotel appears quite dated, both at the reception as well as in the rooms.  The location of the hotel is great if you're coming to get your US visa.  The carpets in the room was stained and so was the floor. The sink in the bathroom was completely blocked and required me to call someone in to fix it. I wonder why hotels don't get these things done themselves when the room is serviced?

The corridors are dowdy and our room, though with a modern bathroom, was a gloomy mish mash of dark furniture and seating.  The crowded breakfast area is indeed in need of renovation - with scratched fittings and sagging chairs. We sought refuge in the Radisson Club, but this was claustrophobic and noisy.  An important point is that this is definitely not a hotel suitable for tourists. It's close to the…"
The Park Chennai,Disappointing overpriced impersonation of a boutique hotel,2,"We had hoped for an upmarket boutiquey hotel for our first couple of nights of our trip.  But 1 - The pre-booked taxi was not present at the airport - our flight had been delayed, but nevertheless, when we called them, they suggested we just grab a cab. Not easy with only 2000 rupee notes ( thanks Mr Modhi). Ended up overpaying in sterling 2 - although we had requested early checkin, we checked in and spent the next hour and a half in the lobby watching 2 reception staff deal with a large queue 3 - finally given a room, and to be fair an upgraded one. But the sofa was stained, the shower curtain was rubbish so bathroom floor flooded( but did not drain); so heaven knows what the basic rooms are like 4 - tried asking the travel desk about hiring a car and driver to Kanchipuram and…"
The Park Chennai,Not the best..,2,"Stayed at a suite for two days at this hotel. While check in was fairly smooth, this hotel certainly doesn't have the quality of a 5 star hotel that it claims to be. The hotel appears quite dated, both at the reception as well as in the rooms.  The location of the hotel is great if you're coming to get your US visa.  The carpets in the room was stained and so was the floor. The sink in the bathroom was completely blocked and required me to call someone in to fix it. I wonder why hotels don't get these things done themselves when the room is serviced? Why does it require a guest to call in?  Even though this was a suite, there was no hairdryer available and it had to be requested for. (Took 40 mins and 2 calls to arrive)  Reception did not give me a 2nd key card because they had…"
Taj Club House,Unfriendly Front Office Male staff!,2,"I was on a family visit to Chennai few weeks ago. I have stayed in Taj Club House a few years back as well.  In comparison to the previous years, the customer service has gone down the drain.

Ridiculous service!! THE ONLY SAVING GRACE OF TAJ CLUB HOUSE IS THE SINGLE WOMAN Ms.RAJESHWARI WHOSE WELCOMING DEMEANOR AND CUSTOMER CARE MAKES IT WORTHWHILE TO STAY IN THIS PLACE.

The Park Chennai,Not fit to be a 5 star. Basic facilities compromised,2,"Being in India you expect hotels to have water for washing up in the WC. Well, this hotel thinks it is located in a European district with only toilet paper.  That's not all. The hotel & room services are very disappointing given the fact Park is a known chain in India. The room has no glasses to drink water. So you use the cans and bottles as it is. There is no iron in the room considering this is a popular business hotel.   How do I even start on a good thing about the hotel except for a very polite front office staff.   There are no electric points near the bed in reach. The one point near the bed is below the side table and not accessible unless you get down on your knees and have a long arm like mine. Better to use the table switches to charge your phone's in the night. …"

The ambience of the hotel and the restaurant was great, but the seating, food and service was very poor.   They arranged seating for 100+ people in 3 tables, so it was terrible. Staff treated our team like cattle. One lady staff in the restaurant desk asked me ""if I am with all 'these people'?"" Apparenlty, she wanted to stop me from sitting in any other (properly arranged) table.  Worst language and service I had seen in any hotel in this category.  The spread was big, many starters, main courses and desserts. But the place was very crowded and it was hard to find the right food. The spread was too widespread. Very few service personnel was there to help and the food quality was below average - except few items like Kozhi…"
The Park Chennai,5 star for a caveman..... maybe.,2,"We recently had a 2 night visit to The Park. The hotel is definitely not the 5 stars it rates itself to be and maybe the management need to visit real 5 star properties and re-evaluate themselves. I rate The Park 3.5 stars (at best).  The entrance is very bland and like no other hotel I have been to. Just a huge wall with big wooden door. No signage or anything to indicate you are at a hotel.  The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.   Like others have mentioned, this hotel is very run down and in urgent need of attention. The rooms have a strange smell and the finishing touches like painting and joinery are of a poor standard. It seems that not a lot of thought went into water run off in the…"

GreenPark Chennai,does not meet the conditions of a 4-star hotel,2,"It is a hotel where there are continually conventions and weddings which create a noisy atmosphere that sometimes makes it difficult to sleep. Privacy is something very important that is not met in this hotel, cleaners who enter the room without calling and a vigilance by the staff of the hotel that comes to take pictures of personal belongings, fact that is proven. The manager of the hotel does not respond to the height of a hotel of its characteristics, remaining in evidence in situations that have made us feel very uncomfortable with their treatment. the cleanliness in some parts of the hotel is not as expected in European hotels, creating the perfect conditions for mosquitoes in bathrooms for example.  the bathrooms of the rooms are not cleaned properly every day, as well as…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Overpriced, overrated",2,"We had unfortunately stayed in this hotel for a couple of days in November and later in the week at Hotel Savera, Mylapore which provided me with an apt comparison of facilities at both hotels. The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale. Only when we had pointed this out they were replaced. Parking…"
The Park Chennai,Lost standards,2,"So I loved my stay at 'The Park' Hyderabad and come on, it's 'The Park'. So I booked 2 nights at 'The Park' Chennai. I was taken to the room, when I noticed construction happening 2 rooms away. I asked them to shift me to another floor immediately. The lady asked me to wait in the room while she checked for availability. No one came back with any answer. And the constant hammering and drilling drove me crazy. So I called the reception and asked them again. They said they'll have the drilling stopped. Nope. Nothing happened. Finally I went and demanded that they change my room. To which they put me in the luxury suite. Note: Luxury suite is a larger room with a shower, while the regular rooms come with a bathtub.

Hilton Chennai,Dodgy and poorly located,2,"OK I was put up here by a company. On arrival first thing they wanted was a Rs 5000/- charge on my card.

Only if you are a Hilton Honours member and ONLY of you make a booking directly with them do you qualify for free wifi else NOFI. If you choose a plan it is a whopping Rs 800 per 24 hours. In the 80's a Justice of the Indian courts coined a term ""DIABOLICAL PROFITEERING""  that is what Hilton in India is doing. Arrogant manager even told me ""high costs of broad band require them to impose such charges. I get one month of 3G data on Indian moblies for less than what Hilton charges for ONE DAY.

The Park Chennai,The Park doesn't deserve 5 STAR status,2,"I had to stay in The Park recently for 4 nights for my VISA interview, and I have booked ""Luxury"" room with 1 Queen Bed for my stay.   I arrived around 9:30 PM, and the reservation desk took a while (around 10 - 15mins) to get the room ready. Moreover, the hotel staffs at the reservation desk were multitasking, keeping me waited at the counter itself. This itself didn't give me a good impression on the reception. The receptionist just gave the room key without informing me anything about where the breakfast will be served / do I have any luggage to be carried to the room. I had to remind them about my luggage to be carried to my room. They gave me a room in the second floor.  1.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.

I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble.

There were 3 group of pax checking in at that time, 1 in midst of check in, myself and another grp of 3pax who was trying to check in.

On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard.

The Park Chennai,Don’t expect to sleep. ,2,"The Park’s lobby is a wonderful example of flashy design winning out over functionality and guest convenience. The furniture in the lobby is perversely uncomfortable.   The restaurant and bar open off the large reception atrium space. The bar hosts a variety of events which involve loud music. Both the nights I stayed the music was blaring out until past 3am and, as the rooms are off the atrium, I got very little sleep.   The rooms are a little more standard in terms of design. The upper floors have a halfhearted sort of Indian Cinema theme with old cinema posters and images of various film stars. I found the bed large but quite soft. Wardrobe hanging space was limited.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Stix (chinese restaurant) sucks!,2,"This review is in specific for the Chinese Restaurant. I have never stayed at the hotel, and hoping im reviewing in the right spot! The restaurant has some of the worst ventilation I have ever come across, even in a 3 star hotel. Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze. Since more than 50% of the seats seemed to be near the open kitchen, I was a little surprised by the wait staff assuring us they could have given us a better table near the lobby, which was now full.  The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not for the light sleeper,2,"The central atrium looks impressive, but actually acts as an echo chamber which amplifies the noise from the reception area. That is bad enough, but when they have music playing loudly until 2am, people chatting noisily until 3am, and then the cleaning and vacuuming starting it makes for a very disturbed night.  The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable).

Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile.

I have stayed in Taj Lake Palace , umed Bhawan palace, Taj Exotica Goa, Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai , Taj Man singh delhi in last one year but this hotel just sucks...

The Park Chennai,Disappointing overpriced impersonation of a boutique hotel,2,"We had hoped for an upmarket boutiquey hotel for our first couple of nights of our trip.  But 1 - The pre-booked taxi was not present at the airport - our flight had been delayed, but nevertheless, when we called them, they suggested we just grab a cab. Not easy with only 2000 rupee notes ( thanks Mr Modhi). Ended up overpaying in sterling 2 - although we had requested early checkin, we checked in and spent the next hour and a half in the lobby watching 2 reception staff deal with a large queue 3 - finally given a room, and to be fair an upgraded one. But the sofa was stained, the shower curtain was rubbish so bathroom floor flooded( but did not drain); so heaven knows what the basic rooms are like 4 - tried asking the travel desk about hiring a car and driver to Kanchipuram and…"
The Park Chennai,Most of the rooms are old and bad. Has a few good rooms which the management seems very reluctant to give.,2,"We stayed here for two nights in February for our visa appointment. We reached the hotel at around 9pm and were pretty shocked with the kind of room they provided us with - old, musty and visibly dirty. The bathroom had paan stains all over, the shower curtains were old and dirty (looks like they weren't washed for years). We called the reception and asked for a change of room, and they moved us to another room that was like 10 times worse than the first. This is the first time we've seen a hotel management moving it's guest to a worse room when being asked for a room change. We asked for another change and they just kept showing us similar bad, worse to worst rooms. Finally we decided to walk out of the hotel,  when we noticed two floors (as the lift stopped at them) seemed to…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.  I stayed at the Raddison hotel, booked through Orbitz.  The Raddison was not cheap, well over 5,000 Rupees for a few hours of stay! I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble. I guess I can live with the exhorbitant price…"

I generally used to say in Radha Regent, Pride or Taj Clubhouse but for the last 3 times since i had work in porur - i decided to stay in this place. One thing which was aptly clear to me is that the place can barely offer bed and breakfast and nothing else. The housekeeping is just average and a lot of energy is wasted in telling and yelling as to how one wants and why one wants it? Two of the pretty most integral questions one keeps on asking. The TV will not have HDMI cords - The washroom will not have hand towels etc. The rooms are contemporary and the design is chic.  The AC noise in my rooms both times was deafening so please check this before you take the…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Overpriced, overrated",2,"We had unfortunately stayed in this hotel for a couple of days in November and later in the week at Hotel Savera, Mylapore which provided me with an apt comparison of facilities at both hotels. The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale. Only when we had pointed this out they were replaced. Parking…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not for the light sleeper,2,"The central atrium looks impressive, but actually acts as an echo chamber which amplifies the noise from the reception area. That is bad enough, but when they have music playing loudly until 2am, people chatting noisily until 3am, and then the cleaning and vacuuming starting it makes for a very disturbed night.  The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable). Unless you have a meeting in the hotel or very…"
The Park Chennai,Not the best..,2,"Stayed at a suite for two days at this hotel. While check in was fairly smooth, this hotel certainly doesn't have the quality of a 5 star hotel that it claims to be. The hotel appears quite dated, both at the reception as well as in the rooms.  The location of the hotel is great if you're coming to get your US visa.  The carpets in the room was stained and so was the floor. The sink in the bathroom was completely blocked and required me to call someone in to fix it. I wonder why hotels don't get these things done themselves when the room is serviced? Why does it require a guest to call in?  Even though this was a suite, there was no hairdryer available and it had to be requested for. (Took 40 mins and 2 calls to arrive)  Reception did not give me a 2nd key card because they had…"

Despite the hotel promoting itself as a premier five star property I had a disappointing experience.  Issues:- 1. Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile. Though there are welcome drinks kept inside a cabinet, I never them offering them to anyone. 3.The rooms are dark, stinky with no approach to…"

The rooms are spacious and the staff courteous, but that is about all the good I can say.  The rooms seem to be recently renovated, where corners have been cut. Certain things seem old.  The bathroom was the major woe. The towels stank... reeked of stale odor. The toothbrush provided had the hardest bristles I have ever experienced. The razor and shaving cream were of the cheapest available brand. For the money you pay, all this is just unacceptable.  The ironing board provided is very small.  I asked for some extra dairy whiteners at 8.40pm, and I was told that they won't be available before morning as the dept was closed. 8.40 isn't even that late!

The Park Chennai,Tardy rooms,2,"The Park is one of the preferred hotels on our company's internal travel portal and hence i had no hesitation in booking this hotel for our stay in Chennai. We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again. To start off the upholstery on the  sofa in the room was worn out, the shower head in the bathroom had rust stains all over them. The hotel room itself was dull and unispiring.

The Park Chennai,Don’t expect to sleep. ,2,"The Park’s lobby is a wonderful example of flashy design winning out over functionality and guest convenience. The furniture in the lobby is perversely uncomfortable.   The restaurant and bar open off the large reception atrium space. The bar hosts a variety of events which involve loud music. Both the nights I stayed the music was blaring out until past 3am and, as the rooms are off the atrium, I got very little sleep.   The rooms are a little more standard in terms of design. The upper floors have a halfhearted sort of Indian Cinema theme with old cinema posters and images of various film stars. I found the bed large but quite soft. Wardrobe hanging space was limited. A lot of the furnishings were a little tired. There are very few electrical sockets and some located very…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good looking property.

To make a long story short: We were shown 11 rooms in total. My friends, who are sensitive to odors, decided to find another hotel to stay in. I settled for the least offensive room and stayed for 3 nights. Just came back home and when I opened my suitcase, the mustly odor had traveled back home with me in my clothes.

The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.

Really bad seating position for work on a laptop. •	Safe was not working and had to get new batteries.

The Park Chennai,Don’t expect to sleep. ,2,"The Park’s lobby is a wonderful example of flashy design winning out over functionality and guest convenience. The furniture in the lobby is perversely uncomfortable.   The restaurant and bar open off the large reception atrium space. The bar hosts a variety of events which involve loud music. Both the nights I stayed the music was blaring out until past 3am and, as the rooms are off the atrium, I got very little sleep.   The rooms are a little more standard in terms of design. The upper floors have a halfhearted sort of Indian Cinema theme with old cinema posters and images of various film stars. I found the bed large but quite soft. Wardrobe hanging space was limited. A lot of the furnishings were a little tired. There are very few electrical sockets and some located very…"
Hilton Chennai,No alcohol served,2,"Many hotels are impacted by no alcohol being served in hotels. The Hilton being one of them. So if you're looking for a place to have a drink after work or a social gathering, avoid staying at the Hilton. In the future I will be looking for a different hotel. …"

The Park Chennai,Poorly maintained but good food,2,Stayed at this place with family for two days. Had been to chennai for a US visa interview. The location is very close to the consulate so was very convenient for us The lobby and rooms were stinking with stale water smell as if we were walking near some sewage drains  The checkin was easy breeze  We had asked for an early checkin and before the reception staff started doing the formalities the first thing he said even before telling welcome was that I had to pay for the days breakfast and the next day was complimentary. Somehow I found it offensive and unwarranted   The wifi is free complimentary and pretty fast.it is in the city centre with plenty of shopping options nearby   The restaurant was decent and the food had good variety and taste the buffet charges were reasonable…
The Park Chennai,5 star for a caveman..... maybe.,2,"We recently had a 2 night visit to The Park. The hotel is definitely not the 5 stars it rates itself to be and maybe the management need to visit real 5 star properties and re-evaluate themselves. I rate The Park 3.5 stars (at best).  The entrance is very bland and like no other hotel I have been to. Just a huge wall with big wooden door. No signage or anything to indicate you are at a hotel.  The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.   Like others have mentioned, this hotel is very run down and in urgent need of attention. The rooms have a strange smell and the finishing touches like painting and joinery are of a poor standard. It seems that not a lot of thought went into water run off in the…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Overpriced & not worth it,2,"I booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights with family because I was looking for a hotel nearby the airport. Nothing was good about my stay. First, the rooms were to congested and small. Too many unnecessary things such as the tables & decorative stuffs. And then the toilet, the furniture were worn out and uncomfortable. Then, it took almost 1 hour for them to send the food that I ordered from room service. The staffs were not giving enough to information when a question is asked. Also, the staff which a guy from the travel desk was rude when I asked some questions. And the worst incident was when I found a HALF EATEN APPLE under the study desk. It was terrible. The price was just too expensive for the stay and not worth it at all. I used to stay in The Hilton chennai, and…"

The Park Chennai,Tardy rooms,2,"The Park is one of the preferred hotels on our company's internal travel portal and hence i had no hesitation in booking this hotel for our stay in Chennai. We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again. To start off the upholstery on the  sofa in the room was worn out, the shower head in the bathroom had rust stains all over them. The hotel room itself was dull and unispiring. It seems to me that the hotel has neglected the maintenance in the rooms and the rooms were a…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…

We made the booking through make my trip however things turned upside down after reaching the hotel.   - The reception keeps over selling the plans (breakfast, airport drop, dinner...etc) even after saying a clear ""NO"". A big turn off. - The booking was made for a couple. The hotel room initially offered to us had two separate beds, we were asked to pay 1300 Rs extra if we wish to take a king size bed else no other rooms were available (Nice trick). They termed it as executive room up-gradation with inclusion of dinner for two members. After up-gradation we found the room to be exactly the same except a joint bed.  -…"

During check in,  hotel receptionist said no indication of any requests.  End up change of room on our 1st day stay at night after we back from day tour, we were tired!!  Look at how ignorant the hotel Management is, even the duty Manager Ayushi!! She is not an asset to the hotel.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good looking property. Just couldn't find a room that didn't have a strong musty odor,2,"Arriving for a 3 night stay last week, myself and a couple of friends we admired the beautiful lobby and were pleased with the restaurant selection located right on the property. Things didn't go so well after we opened the doors to our rooms. A strong, musty odor greeted us. The bathrooms hat water stains and white mold growing on the wall. To make a long story short: We were shown 11 rooms in total. My friends, who are sensitive to odors, decided to find another hotel to stay in. I settled for the least offensive room and stayed for 3 nights. Just came back home and when I opened my suitcase, the mustly odor had traveled back home with me in my clothes.  It's really a shame, because the staff is so very nice and tried to accommodate us. We actually felt bad for them, but what…"

In the lobby there was no AC it was humid as hell and mosquitoes all over the front desk. It got worst from there, elevator same thing, humid, hot no ac, and mosquitoes. When I got to room I was surpised there was AC but was quickly in for a shock. The AC is set at a very cold temperature where I cannot adjust with thermostat. And this is where I got to dealt with the very unhelpful room service service. On and On but, I will leave it here since I will not be back.…"

The furniture is all chipped, wires dangling and lights fused. The daily house keeping trolley is similar to a wooden trolley what beggars pull on the roads. Shampoo, bath gel and laundry bags/sheets are not replenished everyday. The house keeping staff go on all fours to swab the floor. The music from the leather bar can be heard in the rooms at night.Hot water was not available on many days and the answer given was that there was an air lock..... not convincing.However food at the buffet restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not worth the money paid. Not even by a long shot!,2,"Staying at this property for the first time. The rooms are spacious and the staff courteous, but that is about all the good I can say.  The rooms seem to be recently renovated, where corners have been cut. Certain things seem old.  The bathroom was the major woe. The towels stank... reeked of stale odor. The toothbrush provided had the hardest bristles I have ever experienced. The razor and shaving cream were of the cheapest available brand. For the money you pay, all this is just unacceptable.  The ironing board provided is very small.  I asked for some extra dairy whiteners at 8.40pm, and I was told that they won't be available before morning as the dept was closed. 8.40 isn't even that late!

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Overpriced, overrated",2,"We had unfortunately stayed in this hotel for a couple of days in November and later in the week at Hotel Savera, Mylapore which provided me with an apt comparison of facilities at both hotels. The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale. Only when we had pointed this out they were replaced. Parking…"

Well, this hotel thinks it is located in a European district with only toilet paper.  That's not all. The hotel & room services are very disappointing given the fact Park is a known chain in India. The room has no glasses to drink water. So you use the cans and bottles as it is. There is no iron in the room considering this is a popular business hotel.   How do I even start on a good thing about the hotel except for a very polite front office staff.   There are no electric points near the bed in reach. The one point near the bed is below the side table and not accessible unless you get down on your knees and have a long arm like mine. Better to use the table switches to charge your phone's in the night. …"

Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze.

We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. They were throughout our stay very courteous and hospitable.   It made our stay bearable. The rooms are dated, bathroom was dingy and poorly lit. Walls had stains, don't know of what. The main floors are wood and showed its age. Paint in the corners of the room were peeling and looked like the windows haven't been washed for over a decade. We could hear hammering and masonry work from another floor between 10am to about 2pm most days. Not helpful, when you're jet lagged.   The Room Service (food) was tasty but extremely pricey. About 30% in taxes are added on top of the menu price. Compared to US prices,…"

The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"
The Park Chennai,5 star for a caveman..... maybe.,2,"We recently had a 2 night visit to The Park. The hotel is definitely not the 5 stars it rates itself to be and maybe the management need to visit real 5 star properties and re-evaluate themselves. I rate The Park 3.5 stars (at best).  The entrance is very bland and like no other hotel I have been to. Just a huge wall with big wooden door. No signage or anything to indicate you are at a hotel.  The welcome and friendliness of front counter staff was good. They were very helpful and probably the hotels greatest asset.   Like others have mentioned, this hotel is very run down and in urgent need of attention. The rooms have a strange smell and the finishing touches like painting and joinery are of a poor standard. It seems that not a lot of thought went into water run off in the…"
The Park Chennai,GOOD BRAND WITH A RUN DOWN PROPERTY WITH NO ATTENTION OR SERVICES,2,The worst hotel that I have stayed in the recent past. The rooms are totally in a bad and messy state and the house keeping is terrible with dust all round the furniture and fixtures. Service is really bad with no timely response for anything that is asked for!  The only good about the hotel was the quality of the food. Will never ever surely not stay at this property at Chennai…

Everyone seems to be nervous but they don't know what needs to be done. Restaurant service slow and unreliable.

The Park Chennai,The Park doesn't deserve 5 STAR status,2,"I had to stay in The Park recently for 4 nights for my VISA interview, and I have booked ""Luxury"" room with 1 Queen Bed for my stay.   I arrived around 9:30 PM, and the reservation desk took a while (around 10 - 15mins) to get the room ready. Moreover, the hotel staffs at the reservation desk were multitasking, keeping me waited at the counter itself. This itself didn't give me a good impression on the reception. The receptionist just gave the room key without informing me anything about where the breakfast will be served / do I have any luggage to be carried to the room. I had to remind them about my luggage to be carried to my room. They gave me a room in the second floor.  1. The pathway to the room smelled like cigarette smoking & the room also had very unpleasant odor on…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Bubble bursting experience it was!,2,"ITC Grand Chola, to start with, it's just living off its name. The service right from the check-in formalities it's terrible. They make you wait for almost 15-20 mins, the desk staff are on calls and just don't even excuse themselves before they leave, they would keep you waiting. They have coupon for lunch and dinner, which isn't rightly given. There is clearly no coordination between different departments. We had lunch at Cafe Mercara, the staff there are very rude and strange, even after repeating the order, they will miss out on some food items, you need to ask them for basic things like water, it's like reminding them their own duties. We had asked for some extra bowl of rice, they just dint show up and completely ignored the order even after requesting them twice. We…"
The Park Chennai,Disappointing overpriced impersonation of a boutique hotel,2,"We had hoped for an upmarket boutiquey hotel for our first couple of nights of our trip.  But 1 - The pre-booked taxi was not present at the airport - our flight had been delayed, but nevertheless, when we called them, they suggested we just grab a cab. Not easy with only 2000 rupee notes ( thanks Mr Modhi). Ended up overpaying in sterling 2 - although we had requested early checkin, we checked in and spent the next hour and a half in the lobby watching 2 reception staff deal with a large queue 3 - finally given a room, and to be fair an upgraded one. But the sofa was stained, the shower curtain was rubbish so bathroom floor flooded( but did not drain); so heaven knows what the basic rooms are like 4 - tried asking the travel desk about hiring a car and driver to Kanchipuram and…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Overpriced & not worth it,2,"I booked 2 rooms and stayed here for 2 nights with family because I was looking for a hotel nearby the airport. Nothing was good about my stay. First, the rooms were to congested and small. Too many unnecessary things such as the tables & decorative stuffs. And then the toilet, the furniture were worn out and uncomfortable. Then, it took almost 1 hour for them to send the food that I ordered from room service. The staffs were not giving enough to information when a question is asked. Also, the staff which a guy from the travel desk was rude when I asked some questions. And the worst incident was when I found a HALF EATEN APPLE under the study desk. It was terrible. The price was just too expensive for the stay and not worth it at all. I used to stay in The Hilton chennai, and…"
The Park Chennai,Most of the rooms are old and bad. Has a few good rooms which the management seems very reluctant to give.,2,"We stayed here for two nights in February for our visa appointment. We reached the hotel at around 9pm and were pretty shocked with the kind of room they provided us with - old, musty and visibly dirty. The bathroom had paan stains all over, the shower curtains were old and dirty (looks like they weren't washed for years). We called the reception and asked for a change of room, and they moved us to another room that was like 10 times worse than the first. This is the first time we've seen a hotel management moving it's guest to a worse room when being asked for a room change. We asked for another change and they just kept showing us similar bad, worse to worst rooms. Finally we decided to walk out of the hotel,  when we noticed two floors (as the lift stopped at them) seemed to…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not worth the money paid. Not even by a long shot!,2,"Staying at this property for the first time. The rooms are spacious and the staff courteous, but that is about all the good I can say.  The rooms seem to be recently renovated, where corners have been cut. Certain things seem old.  The bathroom was the major woe. The towels stank... reeked of stale odor. The toothbrush provided had the hardest bristles I have ever experienced. The razor and shaving cream were of the cheapest available brand. For the money you pay, all this is just unacceptable.  The ironing board provided is very small.  I asked for some extra dairy whiteners at 8.40pm, and I was told that they won't be available before morning as the dept was closed. 8.40 isn't even that late! If I wanted to have tea/coffee, I had no choice but to order from the restaurant. The…"

The Park Chennai,Not fit to be a 5 star. Basic facilities compromised,2,"Being in India you expect hotels to have water for washing up in the WC. Well, this hotel thinks it is located in a European district with only toilet paper.  That's not all. The hotel & room services are very disappointing given the fact Park is a known chain in India. The room has no glasses to drink water. So you use the cans and bottles as it is. There is no iron in the room considering this is a popular business hotel.   How do I even start on a good thing about the hotel except for a very polite front office staff.   There are no electric points near the bed in reach. The one point near the bed is below the side table and not accessible unless you get down on your knees and have a long arm like mine. Better to use the table switches to charge your phone's in the night. …"

The ambience of the hotel and the restaurant was great, but the seating, food and service was very poor.   They arranged seating for 100+ people in 3 tables, so it was terrible. Staff treated our team like cattle. One lady staff in the restaurant desk asked me ""if I am with all 'these people'?"" Apparenlty, she wanted to stop me from sitting in any other (properly arranged) table.  Worst language and service I had seen in any hotel in this category.  The spread was big, many starters, main courses and desserts. But the place was very crowded and it was hard to find the right food. The spread was too widespread.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not recommend -,2,"Overall, was my first time in India and was excited to be staying at a Hyatt hotel. But, after the moment I walked in I was in for a surprise. In the lobby there was no AC it was humid as hell and mosquitoes all over the front desk. It got worst from there, elevator same thing, humid, hot no ac, and mosquitoes. When I got to room I was surpised there was AC but was quickly in for a shock. The AC is set at a very cold temperature where I cannot adjust with thermostat. And this is where I got to dealt with the very unhelpful room service service. On and On but, I will leave it here since I will not be back.…"
The Park Chennai,Don’t expect to sleep. ,2,"The Park’s lobby is a wonderful example of flashy design winning out over functionality and guest convenience. The furniture in the lobby is perversely uncomfortable.   The restaurant and bar open off the large reception atrium space. The bar hosts a variety of events which involve loud music. Both the nights I stayed the music was blaring out until past 3am and, as the rooms are off the atrium, I got very little sleep.   The rooms are a little more standard in terms of design. The upper floors have a halfhearted sort of Indian Cinema theme with old cinema posters and images of various film stars. I found the bed large but quite soft. Wardrobe hanging space was limited. A lot of the furnishings were a little tired. There are very few electrical sockets and some located very…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.  I stayed at the Raddison hotel, booked through Orbitz.  The Raddison was not cheap, well over 5,000 Rupees for a few hours of stay! I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble. I guess I can live with the exhorbitant price…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Over-charging!,2,"I had to stopover in Chennai and based on its location (close to the airport) and Trip Advisor reviews, I chose Raidisson Blu. This is a rather blend business hotel but with efficient service. However the below incident marred it all.  Upon check-in, we had been ""upgraded"" as the hotel was running full on standard double rooms. However, upon check-out, I was grossly over-charged (by 8% extra) as the hotel staff claimed that the service tax must be applied on the non-discounted rate (ie the rate of the higher-category room). I wasn't informed by the staff upfront, I noticed the problem myself (unfortunately after paying) and when I pointed to the discrepancy with my confirmation slip (from Blu Radisson website), the hotel staff refused to buldge and annoyingly referred to the…"

Sent them email a month ago prior to our stay.  No reply from them.  Made the effort to call them directly from overseas,  spoke to Duty Manager Ayushi,  she said will take note of my requests. During check in,  hotel receptionist said no indication of any requests.  End up change of room on our 1st day stay at night after we back from day tour, we were tired!!  Look at how ignorant the hotel Management is, even the duty Manager Ayushi!! She is not an asset to the hotel. The room was okay expect there was a bad smell from the toilet as i think got some sewage issue. I check out after 3 days, its was my wife's birthday,  the hotel screwed…"

I was very disappointed - and actually checked out and moved to another hotel after 2 days.  I am spending numerous weeks in Chennai and would not have been comfortable in this hotel for more than one or two nights...  My overall experience would be better stated as barely OKAY with lots of issues...  Issues from my point of view:  thin hard mattress; only bed covering is sheet and light cotton spread; two lumpy pillows on the bed; all floors a marble - very cold/hard; smokey smell in the room - called front desk - they told me there are NO non-smoking rooms - woke up in the middle of the night to smoke smell from people in near by rooms; two pieces of…

Struggled to find my room. First time felt an upgrade to bigger room can also be a pain. …"
The Park Chennai,Needs renovation !,2,"The rooms stink, water seepage in the toilet, washbasin was leaking water into the floor, phone was not working. I got stuck in the elevator and took them 5 mins to get me out. My luggage arrived 30 mins after I went to the room. Even though Check in time is 12 noon, I got the room only at about 1pm. Receptionists are not welcoming. The lobby was very noisy due to music being played. And yes last but not least, there was repair going on at 2 in the noon, loud banging, disturbing our sleep.  Only saving grace, food..…"
The Park Chennai,Terrible check-in experience,2,"Arrived 23Oct about 11pm+ after a long flight and all i need was a quick check in and a room so I can get some sleep. Pickup from airport was smooth, but the moment i reached the hotel, the ordeal began.   Check-in: There was about 4-5pax at reception, of which i think about 3 are trainees who was helping the 2main check in guy to photocopy passport and just stand around watching people. There were 3 group of pax checking in at that time, 1 in midst of check in, myself and another grp of 3pax who was trying to check in. While waiting to be served, I can immediately noticed the unhappy faces from all the 2 main check in staff at the desk. As we are all being ignored pretty much, we had to brace the frown and tried to get the guys’ attention to help us chck in. After some waiting,…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Stix (chinese restaurant) sucks!,2,"This review is in specific for the Chinese Restaurant. I have never stayed at the hotel, and hoping im reviewing in the right spot! The restaurant has some of the worst ventilation I have ever come across, even in a 3 star hotel. Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze. Since more than 50% of the seats seemed to be near the open kitchen, I was a little surprised by the wait staff assuring us they could have given us a better table near the lobby, which was now full.  The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"
Taj Club House,Hit and miss,2,"I feel like this hotel is very hit and miss. I choose taj because I expected basic things to be done correctly.  But the rooms was dirty on arrival, the breakfast restaurant is complete chaos, and quality of food and the service was awful. I even went to the trouble of asking the hotel to adjust my room rate (which they did for the extra night) because I didn’t want to deal with the restaurant downstairs for inclusive breakfast, prefer to eat breakfast outside after that.  I can understand some of the comments from other reviews about service, because the front of house reception gives the impression that they are a care free,  and don’t really pay attention ( no real response other than they are sorry)  ... quite a different experience that I have had previously at Taj Lands…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms bad service and condition,2,as in good part. Room were well equipped and spacious. But there were some disappointment with respect to room and restaurant service. I stayed in Room no:910 and the shower on my last day had red colored water with red sand in it? I still have photos of the same. On day One floor towel was missing . On day 2 hand towels were not there and on day 3 my medicine bottle was missing which I was sure that room cleaning lady must have broken it and thrown it away. On day 2 when I went to bar I sat there for 15 minutes and no waiter even came to me with a menu. Even though bar was not full at all. Breakfast buffet was not at all 5 start standard. I can get same variety in a 3 start hotel. Overall I am not looking forward to stay at this hotel again.…
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Not a ""Lemon Tree Experience"".....",2,"I just came back after my trip to Chennai for a week.  i am a kind of follower of Lemon Tree across India. I had very nice experiences with lemon tree properties in India at various locations like Bangalore, Gurgoan, Chandigarh.  So it was Chennai that i selected as Lemon Tree....but finally i have to correct my opinion to ""all lemon tree experiences may not be always same"".  we participated in Chennai exhibition recently and I recommended our company to book lemon tree Chennai for all our team.   the rooms are not clean....not a standard of Lemon tree i am used to the power failures are very often ... some times 4 to 6 minutes. once i was under shower in evening and power suddenly gone off ... it was very scary like all dark and for 4 minutes i was like waiting still for power…"

The Park Chennai,Outright pathetic! ,2,"I stayed here for two nights and was the most horrible hotel experience in a long time.  First, the room we were given had a distinct odour, which we realized came from used wet clothes in the bathroom. The guy just offered to clean the bathroom, but only when i insited on changing the room and said i would check out did he change the room.  Now, when in the new room, i saw all toiletries missing, and asked for housekeeping. The housekeeping guy is asking me what all I need- isn't a bath towel, a face towel, soap and dental kit a normal thing? I had to spell out the details.  Food: Average is the word. The dosas were boring, even the podi dosa that is so famous in chennai. Buffet spread is decent, but i would expect a lot better taste for the price i paid.  Service:  Front desk…"
GreenPark Chennai,Disappointing for a business traveler,2,I came to Chennai for business - and this hotel was recommended due to it's proximity to the Company I was working with.  I was very disappointed - and actually checked out and moved to another hotel after 2 days.  I am spending numerous weeks in Chennai and would not have been comfortable in this hotel for more than one or two nights...  My overall experience would be better stated as barely OKAY with lots of issues...  Issues from my point of view:  thin hard mattress; only bed covering is sheet and light cotton spread; two lumpy pillows on the bed; all floors a marble - very cold/hard; smokey smell in the room - called front desk - they told me there are NO non-smoking rooms - woke up in the middle of the night to smoke smell from people in near by rooms; two pieces of…

Hilton Chennai,No alcohol served,2,"Many hotels are impacted by no alcohol being served in hotels. The Hilton being one of them. So if you're looking for a place to have a drink after work or a social gathering, avoid staying at the Hilton. In the future I will be looking for a different hotel. …"
The Park Chennai,Horrible  experience ,2,"I was in Chennai for 24 hrs and was put up in The Park. I was in my shorts and tank top and no sooner I got inside the bed my thighs started itching so I changed into my jammies and since i was so tired i just fell asleep. I was awoken with a terrible itch and i saw that my entire body was covered in hives!! I went down to the reception to complain but received such a nonchalant response, and when i asked for a medicine, they told me that they don't keep any thus cant help me with it. After a while they changed my room but the lining​ of the new room too was not pristine. Apart from this the food is nice and the staff try to sympathise with you. My advice is don't stay here and look somewhere else. …"
The Park Chennai,Tardy rooms,2,"The Park is one of the preferred hotels on our company's internal travel portal and hence i had no hesitation in booking this hotel for our stay in Chennai. We were given standard rooms and i can say that the rooms given to us for a price or Rs 6500 + taxes for a night were shoddy.   The Park has rooms decorated with Indian film posters of a bygone era and though that concept could have been made for interesting rooms, though the sheer quality (or lack of it) would never ever allow me to visit that hotel again. To start off the upholstery on the  sofa in the room was worn out, the shower head in the bathroom had rust stains all over them. The hotel room itself was dull and unispiring. It seems to me that the hotel has neglected the maintenance in the rooms and the rooms were a…"
The Park Chennai,Not up to the mark!,2,"Bad Experience! I stayed at room no 7025 of  the hotel from 15th to 19th of August 2018. Despite the hotel promoting itself as a premier five star property I had a disappointing experience.  Issues:- 1. Right from the approach to hotel and lobby the hotel is weird and it seems the architect has taken the owners for a ride. When you approach the entrance instead of a grand entrance you have to enter a vestibule type of narrow chamber (reminds of a submarine). I almost thought i entered a wrong place. Again you have to open a huge door to enter the reception. Funny! 2. The people at the reception have a very solemn face. They never smile. Though there are welcome drinks kept inside a cabinet, I never them offering them to anyone. 3.The rooms are dark, stinky with no approach to…"
Hilton Chennai,Poor service!!!,2,"We ended up staying in Hilton Chennai one unfortunate day when, me and my husband, we got locked out of our house! It was late night and we got directed to a centralised call centre for our room reservations. This worked fine and we got our confirmation by mail.  When we reached the hotel, we were asked to provide id cards. My husband provided his.I wasn't carrying one as we got out locked out of the house with just my husband's wallet (thankful for at least that!) We tried explaining this situation to the manager who was refusing to give us the room with out my ID card.They claimed that this clause was mentioned in the confirmation mail.  When we checked the mail, this clause was not to be found anywhere.  At 2 am, my husband(who is generally very even tempered) had to raise…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.  I stayed at the Raddison hotel, booked through Orbitz.  The Raddison was not cheap, well over 5,000 Rupees for a few hours of stay! I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble. I guess I can live with the exhorbitant price…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",They snoop through private belongings,2,"The hotel is beautiful.   But the maids look through your belongings:  I had written a list of small things that needed improvements in the room, small details such as the fact that toiletries were for men, lights that didn't switch off in the bathroom, and a leaky faucet.  Really not much. I wrote the list of repairs as well as personal thoughts in pencil on a pad provided by the hotel and left it on the desk among tons of other business papers.  When we got back, two maids and the head of housekeeping were in our room, apologizing that the service wasn't perfect.  When I asked how they knew about my small complaints, they said they had read my note.  THEY READ MY PRIVATE NOTE.  And they were very proud that they had been proactive.  Adding insult to injury, we had to endure a…"
GreenPark Chennai,Horrible experience ... Beware travellers ,2,"If there is one mistake I can ignore ... Bell boy takes me to an already occupied room, reception misplaces my ID, my luggage wrongly tagged at departure. God saved me on all these occasions. But the mother of all goof up... Although my company booked they said they had no prior authorisation letter... I let them speak to my office person ... Then I produced my credit card to make payment. At that point they refused to accept my card !!! They stood like zombies and wasted my precious 15 minutes while they checked their records !!! got delayed for my next appointment. Point is they have started a hotel with incompetent and I'll grabbed staff. Imagine if they misplaced the passport of the foreign tourists. TOURISTS BEWARE !!! The room service menu card was not in the room and when…"
Hilton Chennai,Dinner,2,"I happen to be at Hilton for a dinner with a friend of mine.

Deseret Kesari South Indian Sweet too was dry,since having a nice time with my friend as well in a good ambience , food did not affect the evening, I informed the Restaurant manager gave him the feed back. Possible cause cooked and kept for long time , since very low guest turnout Until then we were quiet well engrossed in the time we we where spending together  Mr Surya the chef of the hotel came over , should be cause he would have been appraised, but with the attitude which really spoiled the evening, it is upto the Chef to accept the feedback or to reject, which too was made in…"
Hilton Chennai,excellent property,2,"I reached early morning at 5. The taxi could not locate the hotel, so i tried to call them , but the taped message said the line has been disconnected, then i called up the booking website , they also got the same message, then i opened the laptop and located the hotel on the net . After that i reached the hotel. The hotel said , they can provide the room after 10.30 , though the booking was from that day , with a request for early check in at 6. I had to pay for a half day extra. This was unlike any other hotel, if the rooms are empty , they allow the guest to check in . Being a new hotel , the rooms are well done , the property is well designed. the breakfast is decent. the staff at the restaurant gave very good service.…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not worth the money paid. Not even by a long shot!,2,"Staying at this property for the first time. The rooms are spacious and the staff courteous, but that is about all the good I can say.  The rooms seem to be recently renovated, where corners have been cut. Certain things seem old.  The bathroom was the major woe. The towels stank... reeked of stale odor. The toothbrush provided had the hardest bristles I have ever experienced. The razor and shaving cream were of the cheapest available brand. For the money you pay, all this is just unacceptable.  The ironing board provided is very small.  I asked for some extra dairy whiteners at 8.40pm, and I was told that they won't be available before morning as the dept was closed. 8.40 isn't even that late! If I wanted to have tea/coffee, I had no choice but to order from the restaurant. The…"

How are we trusting the chef, that he is cooking good food or customers are finding hair in the food. The chef yesterday accepted that the plates were also not clean at all. No action taken yet.  Thank you!…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Disappointing stay, best to avoid ",2,"Am writing this review while still staying here so there can be more incidents after this which may make me change my views. Had chosen this hotel coz: 1) my previous stays in park Hyatt and Hyatt regency were not that great. 2) had lays has great expedites staying in other ITC hotels like ITC Gardenia, etc  But maybe due to high expectations was disappointed and let me start why : 1) flight was delayed by an hour but pick up was there on time. But this was the smallest car pick up I have ever had. An old Honda city. I was like ok. Any quad nearby so why worry  2) when u reached the hotel there where like buses and vans on the porch with hundreds of people. It seems it was some office function which got over. So no one was there to great me who was a guest staying in the hotel.…"
GreenPark Chennai,Poor attention to detail,2,"We went in August and stayed for  a week and myself and my two children were looking forward to a dip in the swimming pool every day to escape the Chennai heat - Alas, the pool was closed for maintenance !! - without any no prior notification!!!. A five star hotel expecting foreign visitors should not close its swimming pool for maintenace during the peak holiday season (ie, school holiday period in the US, UK, Europe and Canada, when a lot of foreign tourists visit India). Can the yearly maintenance not be carried out in March? Also, twice (Sundays on both occasions), I saw people vomitting near the barbecue by the swimming pool - they were high on alcohol. Looked like they were locals attending one of the parties in the many function rooms in the Hotel. Too many of the people…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Below Average,2,"What would you feel, if you land at the hotel in midnight and find the frond desk and lobby deserted?  Landed late night at  Chennai, reached hotel at midnight found the lobby deserted, no one at the reception to receive.  I requested for a King Size Non Smoking room on higher floor. Reiterated it to the fron desk executive twice, and to my surprise, I was give a claustrophobic, queen bed 8x8 room. The front desk executive didn't even bother to inform me.   Horrible and pathetic service.  Food is average, I tried dessert, couldn't differentiate whether it was ""Carrot Kheer"" or sugar syrup.  Ahmedabad, Delhi and then Chennai, I have lost faith in Lemontree Chain.   Very very disappointed   The only property that till date I found good is Bengaluru Ulsoor Lake. I may continue…"

Only if you are a Hilton Honours member and ONLY of you make a booking directly with them do you qualify for free wifi else NOFI. If you choose a plan it is a whopping Rs 800 per 24 hours. In the 80's a Justice of the Indian courts coined a term ""DIABOLICAL PROFITEERING""  that is what Hilton in India is doing.

The Park Chennai,Basic Hotel... not 5 star worthy.,2,"Stayed for 5 days with wife and baby. We booked through MakeMyTrip.com and requested a newer remodeled room but none were available.   We were welcomed by a very friendly staff. They were throughout our stay very courteous and hospitable.   It made our stay bearable. The rooms are dated, bathroom was dingy and poorly lit. Walls had stains, don't know of what. The main floors are wood and showed its age. Paint in the corners of the room were peeling and looked like the windows haven't been washed for over a decade. We could hear hammering and masonry work from another floor between 10am to about 2pm most days. Not helpful, when you're jet lagged.   The Room Service (food) was tasty but extremely pricey. About 30% in taxes are added on top of the menu price. Compared to US prices,…"

Moreover, the hotel staffs at the reservation desk were multitasking, keeping me waited at the counter itself. This itself didn't give me a good impression on the reception. The receptionist just gave the room key without informing me anything about where the breakfast will be served / do I have any luggage to be carried to the room. I had to remind them about my luggage to be carried to my room. They gave me a room in the second floor.  1.

The Park Chennai,Rooms are in poor upkeep,2,"I stayed in the Park, Chennai for one month. The room that I was given first was absolutely depressing with hair all over the room and bathroom and walls with damp marks. After making a noise they changed my room to 4012. The room was cleaner. The furniture is all chipped, wires dangling and lights fused. The daily house keeping trolley is similar to a wooden trolley what beggars pull on the roads. Shampoo, bath gel and laundry bags/sheets are not replenished everyday. The house keeping staff go on all fours to swab the floor. The music from the leather bar can be heard in the rooms at night.Hot water was not available on many days and the answer given was that there was an air lock..... not convincing.However food at the buffet restaurant on the ground floor was excellent and…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not for the light sleeper,2,"The central atrium looks impressive, but actually acts as an echo chamber which amplifies the noise from the reception area. That is bad enough, but when they have music playing loudly until 2am, people chatting noisily until 3am, and then the cleaning and vacuuming starting it makes for a very disturbed night.  The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable). Unless you have a meeting in the hotel or very…"

In the lobby there was no AC it was humid as hell and mosquitoes all over the front desk. It got worst from there, elevator same thing, humid, hot no ac, and mosquitoes. When I got to room I was surpised there was AC but was quickly in for a shock. The AC is set at a very cold temperature where I cannot adjust with thermostat.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Disappointing - definitely unsuitable for tourists,2,"As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby at around 10pm on a Friday night, I felt disappointed.  The hotel's website had indeed exaggerated the size and grandeur of the lobby, and it was filled with noise and people. The seating in the lounge area had lost its springs many moons ago.  Over two nights I came to realize that the hotel is overpriced and in need of renovation.  The corridors are dowdy and our room, though with a modern bathroom, was a gloomy mish mash of dark furniture and seating.  The crowded breakfast area is indeed in need of renovation - with scratched fittings and sagging chairs. We sought refuge in the Radisson Club, but this was claustrophobic and noisy.  An important point is that this is definitely not a hotel suitable for tourists. It's close to the…"

Its is minimum courtesy to inform weather you have upgraded us or not, Its not at all professional to inform us we were upgraded and not being done in fact. We did wait 10 mins for them to process the upgrade which was never done. The Breakfast resturant is way overcrowded for the 580 odd rooms they have and the tables are way too small to hold the big plates and there is a long delay for the staff to clear the plates, You have to go reming the live counter staff twice to give you your order…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Stix (chinese restaurant) sucks!,2,"This review is in specific for the Chinese Restaurant. I have never stayed at the hotel, and hoping im reviewing in the right spot! The restaurant has some of the worst ventilation I have ever come across, even in a 3 star hotel. Seated near the open kitchen with a table for 8, most of us were wedded to our napkins trying not to sneeze. Since more than 50% of the seats seemed to be near the open kitchen, I was a little surprised by the wait staff assuring us they could have given us a better table near the lobby, which was now full.  The food seemed tasty, the drinks menu was miniscule, but none of this mattered. We were all just in a hurry to get out of the odours (thanks for the dry cleaning bills!) and smoke.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Worst group lunch @Madras pavilion restaurant, not recommended.",2,"Been to a team lunch @ Madras Pavailion restaurant.   The ambience of the hotel and the restaurant was great, but the seating, food and service was very poor.   They arranged seating for 100+ people in 3 tables, so it was terrible. Staff treated our team like cattle. One lady staff in the restaurant desk asked me ""if I am with all 'these people'?"" Apparenlty, she wanted to stop me from sitting in any other (properly arranged) table.  Worst language and service I had seen in any hotel in this category.  The spread was big, many starters, main courses and desserts. But the place was very crowded and it was hard to find the right food. The spread was too widespread. Very few service personnel was there to help and the food quality was below average - except few items like Kozhi…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Over-charging!,2,"I had to stopover in Chennai and based on its location (close to the airport) and Trip Advisor reviews, I chose Raidisson Blu. This is a rather blend business hotel but with efficient service. However the below incident marred it all.  Upon check-in, we had been ""upgraded"" as the hotel was running full on standard double rooms. However, upon check-out, I was grossly over-charged (by 8% extra) as the hotel staff claimed that the service tax must be applied on the non-discounted rate (ie the rate of the higher-category room). I wasn't informed by the staff upfront, I noticed the problem myself (unfortunately after paying) and when I pointed to the discrepancy with my confirmation slip (from Blu Radisson website), the hotel staff refused to buldge and annoyingly referred to the…"
The Park Chennai,Lost standards,2,"So I loved my stay at 'The Park' Hyderabad and come on, it's 'The Park'. So I booked 2 nights at 'The Park' Chennai. I was taken to the room, when I noticed construction happening 2 rooms away. I asked them to shift me to another floor immediately. The lady asked me to wait in the room while she checked for availability. No one came back with any answer. And the constant hammering and drilling drove me crazy. So I called the reception and asked them again. They said they'll have the drilling stopped. Nope. Nothing happened. Finally I went and demanded that they change my room. To which they put me in the luxury suite. Note: Luxury suite is a larger room with a shower, while the regular rooms come with a bathtub.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not worth the money paid. Not even by a long shot!,2,"Staying at this property for the first time. The rooms are spacious and the staff courteous, but that is about all the good I can say.  The rooms seem to be recently renovated, where corners have been cut. Certain things seem old.  The bathroom was the major woe. The towels stank... reeked of stale odor. The toothbrush provided had the hardest bristles I have ever experienced. The razor and shaving cream were of the cheapest available brand. For the money you pay, all this is just unacceptable.  The ironing board provided is very small.  I asked for some extra dairy whiteners at 8.40pm, and I was told that they won't be available before morning as the dept was closed. 8.40 isn't even that late! If I wanted to have tea/coffee, I had no choice but to order from the restaurant. The…"

I was awoken with a terrible itch and i saw that my entire body was covered in hives!! I went down to the reception to complain but received such a nonchalant response, and when i asked for a medicine, they told me that they don't keep any thus cant help me with it. After a while they changed my room but the lining​ of the new room too was not pristine. Apart from this the food is nice and the staff try to sympathise with you.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Very disappointing,2,"I was in Chennai for a few hours on August 20, connecting from a domestic flight arriving in late afternoon to an internation flight at midnight.  I stayed at the Raddison hotel, booked through Orbitz.  The Raddison was not cheap, well over 5,000 Rupees for a few hours of stay! I chose the hotel because I wanted to have a hot shower, rest, eat dinner before embarking on my long trip to the United States. Room service was miserably slow, the food was not up to par, and the worst of it was that when I went to take a shower there was no hot water available!  Ever tried to wash your hair with cold water late at night in an AC room? I do not recommend the experience.  The staff and guest relation manager could do little about the proble. I guess I can live with the exhorbitant price…"
The Park Chennai,Dirty room and bathroom ,2, I had stayed with this  hotel on 26-04-17 and check out on 27-04-17. I want to say that my stay was really bad as I found the room and toilet very dirty the paint was chipped on the room wall and over all the room was really dirty. I chose this  hotel seeing the rating on trip advisor and also on booking.com but am sorry to say this hotel was rated 5 star on booking.com but I did not feel a single thing 5 star about the hotel. The hotel needs a huge renovation over all. The walk way from lift to room was very bad it felt as if I was in a lodge.really embarrassed to stay with this hotel. Not worth the money.…

Really not much. I wrote the list of repairs as well as personal thoughts in pencil on a pad provided by the hotel and left it on the desk among tons of other business papers.  When we got back, two maids and the head of housekeeping were in our room, apologizing that the service wasn't perfect.  When I asked how they knew about my small complaints, they said they had read my note.  THEY READ MY PRIVATE NOTE.  And they were very proud that they had been proactive.  Adding insult to injury, we had to endure a…"

The Park Chennai,Outright pathetic! ,2,"I stayed here for two nights and was the most horrible hotel experience in a long time.  First, the room we were given had a distinct odour, which we realized came from used wet clothes in the bathroom. The guy just offered to clean the bathroom, but only when i insited on changing the room and said i would check out did he change the room.  Now, when in the new room, i saw all toiletries missing, and asked for housekeeping. The housekeeping guy is asking me what all I need- isn't a bath towel, a face towel, soap and dental kit a normal thing? I had to spell out the details.  Food: Average is the word. The dosas were boring, even the podi dosa that is so famous in chennai. Buffet spread is decent, but i would expect a lot better taste for the price i paid.  Service:  Front desk…"

The pricing of Hotel Savera was at least 30% lesser with better facilities.  I had expected much of the Lemon Tree brand but was disappointed. The hotel refused to provide a second key card for my wife citing vague reasons. As this was required to travel in the lift or to go to some other floor it was very inconvenient if we had to move about separately. The storage space in the room was meager and also there was no safe in the room. Breakfast sperad was not great and on that particular day the sambhar and Juice were stale.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not for the light sleeper,2,"The central atrium looks impressive, but actually acts as an echo chamber which amplifies the noise from the reception area. That is bad enough, but when they have music playing loudly until 2am, people chatting noisily until 3am, and then the cleaning and vacuuming starting it makes for a very disturbed night.  The restaurants are very good, but the breakfast a little disappointing (for a European). There are lots of staff, but all appear to be there for their own benefit rather than adding value - with so many staff there is simply no excuse for having broken locks in the toilets or to be so ineffective at supplying towels (I was there for 4 nights and once I had no towels at all and once no hand or floor towels - inexcusable).

I was with a colleague and I must say that our collective experience was average, at best. First, check-in took more than 30 minutes as the guys at the reception made several mistakes in room assignments and ultimately had to keep us waiting to sort the rooms out. Service at the restaurant was equally average as the waiters were simply not too interested in customer service. The only good thing for me was the room itself. Was neat and comfortable. Overall Service was average.  Having said that, I wont hesitate to add that Lemon tree is a good brand judging from my experience in other locations especially Bangalore.

The photos looked huge and grand and imposing, and I anticipated it being something very special. Unfortunately, when I did stay I found it huge, and grand, but ultimately underwhelming.

Review: This can't possibly be the 2nd best hotel in Chennai and is definitely and not up to standards for Radisson Blu. If you've been to their locations in Europe, you'll be surprised this is allowed to be called a Radisson Blu.  On the good side, the beds are very comfortable, the staff is accomodating, and the lunch buffet was tasty.  On the not so good side, the rooms are musty, poorly cleaned over the years (my shower had mildew that looked like it had been there for years), and tired. I had 2 different rooms and both were of equally poor quality, so I don't think it was an anomoly.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","EXCELLENT INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICE TO IMPROVE !",3,"This is a 3-month new Flagship Luxury property in Chennai of the ITC Hotel Chain, located close to the Airport. Large acreage, large palatial structure with large interiors & massive columns - all signifying the ambitious Chola kingdom that built the huge 'BIg' Temple centuries ago in this State. 3 large pools, Gym, Spa etc. are lavish.  While the massive size, both external & internal, are impressive, the relatively lower height of the two wings of the main lobby & the predominant brown decor tend to be somewhat intimidating & claustrophobic. The Elevators are silent & quick, but have both manual & electronic key-card operation, & the latter was not working in some.  The Executive Club room that we stayed in was somewhat cramped, mainly due to the large space occupied by the en…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Excellent spa but poor service and unclean rooms,3,"Hotel has excellent spa and spa staff. Room service is inconsistent, slow and regularly items on menu are not available.

Recommend spa but more like 3 star hotel overall experience.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not a good first impression!,3,"I stayed at Hyatt Regency Chennai for 2 nights on a recent trip to India, and I was not at all impressed with the rooms. The hotel seems good, and the staff was ok. The hotel reception and centrally located main seating area is wonderfully designed, but I did not find the rooms on par with the rest of the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and designed well, but that's where all good things come to an end. In my suite, I always found tiny insects flying around. The sofa in the seating room had a massive stain and when I requested for it to be changed, the seat was just reversed so the stain was not visible. The restroom had water stagnation problem, and the stand-in shower door was missing all together. All of these problems were reported to the front-desk on day one, but they…"

GreenPark Chennai,Good Hotel...poor service,3,"I stayed at Green Park last week for 3 days for a company conference.  While the hotel itself is good, the service seems bit sketchy. Since the company had booked the conference facilities at the hotel, we got a special rate for booking rooms at the hotel. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I'd been upgraded to Business Club Room.  However, this pleasant surprise was short-lived. I came to know that while the room was being upgraded, the benefits of the room weren't! It meant that I couldn't avail the facilities and benefits that came with that category of the room. I wonder what kind of ""upgrade"" was this!!!  When I inquired about this at the reception, the folks there were clueless...what more could I have expected!!! When I requested that I speak with the…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nice hotel but pricey !,3,"This is a ""marbellous"" hotel and like one of the other reviewers said they have invested a lot in the building itself.

We stayed in the Towers Room. A day prior to check-in we had requested an extra bed and they had assured us that they would keep it ready. After checking in it took a couple of phone calls and in-person visits to the Towers Reception to get the bed.  Everything in the room is controlled via the iPad including the lighting and there are a few glitches there as the lights behind the TV keeping turning themselves on and off.

GreenPark Chennai,Local hotel,3,"This is a typical Indian style hotel. The room is spacious and clean with light musky smell all the time. I wish they could have provided better lighting for the room and bathroom. Feel it is quite dark especially in the bathroom. The funky looking shower didn't work. I've never seen such a shower in any hotel! The staff in general are quite good and helpful except for the front desk staff by the name of Murugan who showed grouchiness when we inquired about room service bill.  The restaurant for breakfast can be very crowded as it is quite small so do plan ahead if you are rushing out. Food is good in both restaurant but find it quite pricey. As for the location, it is located at one of the busiest street next to Forum Mall. Shopping can be convenient although i find it is…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Grand Infrastructure.. Not so grand Service!,3,One look at the building from the outside and the inside and you immediately know why this place is called Grand Chola. My wife and me decided to stay her for our first anniversary. We stayed in a Tower room. Since the property is still under constructio we were driven all around it to get to reception from the entrance. But that was actually nice because it gives you a sense of how big this hotel really is. tower rooms have their own check-in and check-in was smooth. Our room wasn't ready on arrival and in the meantime we were given a tour of the hotel and its facilities. Some of the architecture is jaw dropping. We were then taken to our room and shown how everything was connected to the iPad. Lunch at Peshawri was absolutely mind blowing. Some of the best food I have ever…
Taj Club House,Taj clubhouse is average for business travel,3,Visited taj clubhouse in October for 3 days for a business trip. It was a decent stay but expected more from taj.  1.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,An unexpected- average experience,3,"We arrived in Chennai at early hours and checked in by 4 am. Surprisingly, they do not have paid early checkin facility. We had to pay for 2 nights even if we were checking out at 6.30, next day. We couldn’t have breakfast and all they could pack for us on request was a packed juice and croissants sans tte promised veg-cheese sandwich. We had to get out early as we were flying to Andamans.  No value for money, rooms weren’t up to ‘Radisson’ standard.  Housekeeping staff and restaurant staff were nice. Overall, a big disappointment.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Highs and lows...,3,"Location - Mount Road, Cant beat it.  Checkin - Effecient, Warm [with a room upgrade to boot]  Luggage - Someone forgot to send it up to our room. And it took multiple reminders for it to finally get to our room  Room - Pretty nice. Sore points - The shower stalls needed a good scrub. The joints had black stains from water, soap and other grime! Pretty gross for a Hyatt. I would say that housekeeping - maintenance of bathrooms is poor.  Restaurant - We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was nice. But, the service was disappointing. We never got several of orders from the live counters. They were just overwhelmed with a half full restaurant.  Valet - Attentive and helpful. But, there could be a delay of 15+ minutes to fetch your car. I would recommend self parking if you are…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not the best at that price point!,3,"Well, the hotel is situated right in the middle of the city. Some how, unlike my other Hyatt experiences, this was pretty average. There were many people as their reception staffs, yet they took more than 30 minutes to get my room, which was prepaid! They lacked attitude and training. And after reaching the room with the luggage, it was found that the key was not programmed - again go back to reception, wait, get it programmed and finally opened the door after a neat 30+ minutes. The room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was huge with a nice tub. The TV lacked choices of channels and bed was nice. I didn't try any of the foods, including breakfast and hence no comments. The check out was just ok, which took 10 minutes again! In one sentence, barring the front desk…"

The Traffic to reach this hotel has made me so tired that next time I will never think of going to this hotel. Belive me it has taken 45 min travel from Satyam theater to this hotel at snail pace of traffic for a distance of 5km abd once your enter the hotel the only grand thing is the lobby level other then that nothing much to say, there are only two fresh rooms avaible at the both ends of the banquets which are very far away , one has to walk some hundreds of meters to reach.

At this time, no one was there to greet and to ask us to have welcome drink. 3. Water was leaking from bathroom glass to bedroom. Lot of inconvenience. We had to put lot of towels. No response, when i called '9' on phone. I had demonstrated this to duty manager at the time of checkout. He accepted it as a failure. 4. While we were down to have breakfast, no one is there to greet us and to show place to sit.  we had to wait for 10 min and asked on going waiter. 5. Just 10 min after we checked into the room, one…"

It get disconnected frequently so i had to use my mobile data for work.  Check-in experience was good, service in restaurant was good and food also was good.

Our stay was most enjoyable until check out. When have friends living nearby Chennai that advised us to visit Mahabalipuram (really recommendable). When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the travel desk to book an excursion. They had a 10h excursion on offer at reasonable price. We, however, didn't have any interest in visiting a crocodile park etc. and asked for a price to just go for 1/2 day to see the temples. They were initially totally infexible but eventually agreed and at a lesser price. They insisted it takes 2 1/2 h one way, while we know it's about 1 1/2h drive, which it was. The excursion, at the agreed price, was written into their…"

Detailed review:Grand hotel, well maintained property. Suite that we stayed was Chola suite. It was huge and well maintained as per the standards. No his and her wash sinks though. We kept our preferences open with the team, but our hotel experience never made us feel special and all. It was rather a normal, everyday stay. Not even a welcome drink was served. Suite wasn't welcoming for a newly wedded couple. We understand that no floral arrangements can be made on the bed as it will spoil the linen, but no other place in the suite was made up special for newly wedded couple. Underwhelming experience when you are going for special day or occasion. So we decided not to…"

I received keys to another guest's room by mistake. Air conditioning often gives trouble. Mattresses are not the most comfortable.   What redeems this hotel is exceptional cuisine. Breakfast is mouth watering. South Indian dishes are very, very authentic. Visit Peshawari or the Asian cuisine restaurant.   This should be a 5 rating hotel. …"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",This property doesn't really live up to expectations!!!,3,"This hotel is just 15 minutes away from the airport - a big advantage if you are in Chennai on a business trip. But my stay here was quite a let down. Expected better service given that this is a 3 star or 4 star property. On the first day, I had to wait almost 45 minutes for a table at the Citrus cafe. The dining area is quite small and there was a big group that had gathered at the cafe for dinner that day. Ideally the hotel should have made alternate arrangements for free in-room dining in such situations. But I was told that in-room dining would call for additional charges. Though I wanted to retire early for the day, I had to simply wait until 10.30 pm for a table in the dining area, and all just for a very simple meal. The room was also not well-equipped...i had to ask for…"

I received a call from the hotel a day before for my check in time however at arrival at around 3:00pm next day i still had to wait for an hour for room to be available. Then i was informed i am being upgraded. Not happy with the room in spite of being upgraded. The room was exactly the same as i stayed last time (without the upgrade) so not clear what was upgrade all about.   Choice of TV channels is very poor. No HD channels and set-up box is very slow and outdated.  Not the experience expected from Taj Group.…

Indian hotel staff still have a long way to go. Rooms have some classic furniture but the cleanliness needs to go up a bit and the carpets on the corridor look tired.   Went to the spa, the hostess was lovely and the treatment option we had involved a 90 min massage. The girls were Mizo but spoke reasonable english.

But the hotel has physical problems; in our case, the room key became inoperative several times a day, there was no hot water, and the shower didn't drain.  In each of these cases, the hotel promptly sent a repair person, and the fix lasted for an hour or so, before recurring.  We stayed here for four nights, and these problems never went away.  There are three restaurants.  The Indian restaurant has a wide ranging buffet, which was quite good.

Upon returning a year later, the hotel has really started to dip. The rooms this year were stuff, smelly, dim lighting and stains on the chaise, the curtains and the countertops. There were a few dead bugs in the bathroom and the curtains were broken and would not close. There was NO hot water for 2 days. I was traveling with a group and none of us could get hot water. The breakfast buffet also went downhill. Last year it was one of my favorites in the 6 hotels I stayed at across India, this year it was toward the bottom. We had to ask for drinks multiple times. The plates and napkins were dirty and ordered food, like dosas and eggs, never arrived to the table. There were also mosquitos everywhere. I…"

Service is very good though, but that is now expected of most hotels in this range too.  Bed was comfortable, the ac worked well and the room looked in ship shape. So from the inside, there was no problem. Room service was efficient and food tasted good. View - nothing to boast about. I had stayed in room 8302.  There are some good deals for patrons though.

The sheer experience of dining at the ITC brand is ruined!  If this is the training the staff attending the phones have received, one can only imagine how horrible the other…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Poor service,3,"Too many staff in the front office. Most of them not trained properly. Often the senior front office executives or lobby managers are always busy talking among themselves. Extremely laid back in service. If there is a marriage function or any banquet function, getting in and out of this hotel is a mess. Food is average. Drinks are very expensive. The only advantage of this hotel is its location. Else this is an over-rated, poorly run hotel.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Staff needs to be trained,3,"The only thing that needs to change is the ATTITUDE of the staff, not at all responsive, no proper answers to the queries being raised , overall it was my first stay and last stay at Hyatt Regency.

The lobby is amazing ...rite out of a fantasy...pool never looked better. Having seen these,the rooms ...just disappointed!! But decent good sized ones. Nothing amazing. Service....considering it was during a conference... Not much to say... Food....the flagship Peshawar made THE best North Western food ever. The Madras pavilion decent....the coffee shop amazing desserts!!  Though we had visited the hotel umpteen number of times during the time we were based in Chennai....al of them good...the one stay was just OK!! …"
GreenPark Chennai,Good base for Chennai,3,"3 is slightly harsh, this should be a 3.5.    Stayed for 2 days while in Chennai.  Hotel is about 30-40min by taxi from the airport due to traffic.  Overall good value.   The rooms are very spacious with comfortable (firm) King size bed and pillows.  Cleanliness of the room could be improved though - bedside tables and desk tops could do with a proper clean / wipe.   Bathroom is spacious and clean.  Has a handheld shower and a rain shower - good water pressure.  however sometimes  jumps from hot to cooler water and back every now and then.    Large desk and complementary WiFi in the room could suit business travellers.  Hotel also seems quite popular for weddings.   Service is friendly but due to some language barriers not always efficient (especially telephone requests from…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not their usual level of service ,3,To begin with the check in was pretty slow. This was also due to some unruly guests who did not bring their ID proof with address and kept on barging in while the staff was doing my check in. But I thought the staff should have politely asked to them to wait rather than trying to manage both & not able to do that.   The room was small but comfortable with all the basic amenities present. The Wifi was fast & ensures that I finish my work fast.   I went to the swimming pool in the evening around 815 pm. It’s an open air pool and one of the smallest pool I have seen. The temperature of the water was very comfortable.  But I could see that the picture water was not clean as there were dust sediments floating over the water. Also the pool was completely unattended. While I was…
The Park Chennai,Loud and busy hotel,3,"I stayed at the park for one night during a recent trip to Chennai.  Although the rooms and room facilities are decent, please keep in mind that it's a very busy and loud hotel at night.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Great hardware, poor software ",3,"The building is huge. The staircase at the lobby is magnificent. Rooms are nice with iPad controls. Be careful in the corridors - a staff pushing a service cart almost dashed into me.   But the service is poor. Staff not the best trained. Mistakes happen at check in. I received keys to another guest's room by mistake. Air conditioning often gives trouble. Mattresses are not the most comfortable.   What redeems this hotel is exceptional cuisine. Breakfast is mouth watering. South Indian dishes are very, very authentic. Visit Peshawari or the Asian cuisine restaurant.   This should be a 5 rating hotel. …"
The Park Chennai,"Nothing great, mediocore",3,"I stayed there for my Visa interview at chennai. The room given to me was very substandard, not at all a 5 star level. The room was at a corner and not well maintained. They have a store room or something next to the room so early morning there was lot of noise because of which my sleep was disrupted. Some staffs at counter was not helpful at all. They do not provide information about their complimentary services unless you ask them. The breakfast provided at their restaurant was just at par, could you be much better, same with the service there. They have a late checkout option which they hesitate to disclose to customers. Upon asking they say 2 pm but I could see some of their regular airline customers check out as late as 3:30pm. I would not visit them again given an option,…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Just okay,3,"I booked a meeting here, rooms for the attendees, and stayed for 4 nights myself. The reservation system needs work: they tried to check me out 3 days early, I had to confirm FOUR times the people I had booked for 2 nights...staff friendly and helpful, but you can tell something is not working.  The rooms are just okay: no desk lighting, weird bathroom doors (okay if alone, awkward if not!!), dryer requires thumb hold (if you've got hair to dry you'll understand!), no black out window screens, coffee is nescafe powder but there are liquid creamers, standard wifi was good (no need to upgrade). It was clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable. Hate the closet in the bathroom with no door though - easy to get stuff on your clothes and I prefer privacy. It was also very hot on the…"
Taj Club House,Fish smelt like fish,3,"I was transiting via Chennai in the middle of the night and needed to get some food (because Chennai airport is hopeless). That's how and why I ended up at Taj Club House at 4am. There was only one single guest in the whole ground floor of the hotel - me. It was a bit spooky. How old is this place anyway? I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest. I'm not sure what the story of the hotel is, but I think I need to return during the day to see if it's going to be a different scene.…"

GreenPark Chennai,Misleading 5*,3,"We booked this hotel after being recommended by our friends who had recently stayed for a wedding.   The hotel itself is located opposite a mall, very convenient if your trip involves shopping, eating nice food and there are places in the mall to entertain kids.   Room: The room is very much out dated and in need of an up-lift. I knew this already through the pictures on trip advisor, however I was under the impression that it would be very clean still.  On the day of arrival, they were exceptionally good in providing us with a room earlier than the usual check in time. As I removed the duvet from the bed to put my very tired kids to bed after a 24 hour journey to India, I noticed so many small hair on the bed. It was digusting! And started to wonder what else they Jang changed…"

The Park Chennai,A rather disappointing experience.,3,"We decided to stay here owing to the comfort of access to the embassy and other places in and around the city. This was our second time at the park and we were disappointed with the service of the reception staff as they took a long long time during the check-in and check-out process. The room was okay but the restrooms need an immediate make-over. They look overused and the leakage in the pipe under the sink was not fixed prior to the assigning of the room. The toiletries were inadequate for two of us. Overall, a rather disappointing experience for the amount of money spent.…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Not as promised,3,"Friendly and professional staff. Check in was quick and flawless.  Opted for a club room, which is said to have a ""Private spa tub"". That is however a lie. The room only had a shower.  To be fair, I did not complain about this fact since I was just not up for it, but during the rest of my stay it really annoyed me and I regret I didn't complain about it.  The breakfast buffe was medioker at best, good service but poor selection of food.  Did not visit the club lounge since I did not know where it was and did not bother to ask for it.  The air condition in my room was terribly loud so I had to shut it of during the nights to be able to sleep.   Location if good if you want to be near the airport, it takes about 1 hour to get to city center with taxi due to the traffic.  Pool area…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,"Good location, good service",3,"With a short taxi ride from the airport, The Radisson Blu offers a good central location to make a base from. The hallways are clean and well maintained, the rooms however could do with a little maintenance, especially in the bathroom.  The availability of hot water was a little variable. The fridge was well stocked and replenished daily. The Gym whilst small, was never busy in the morning during my stay, although could do with the aircon being turned on before it opens. I met the chef in the restaurant a couple of times, a pleasant gentleman offering suggestions and being generally helpful, unfortunately a little too attentive once the food had arrived, he seem to keep wanting gratification for his service. Don't bother with the kebab factory, the staff didn't listen to…"

But it has the worst food that I have ever eaten in Chennai. The buffet meals at the conference were inedible, the room service food was below average. It was the cooking without passion. I ate 6 meals there, and obviously tried different dishes each time. Each dish was bad to very bad !!  Wondering what the chef is in a bad mood about.…"
GreenPark Chennai,Manager needs to wake up and engage with hotel guests,3,"I had previously given a very good score for this hotel, but this time round, I was disappointed. When I am writing ‘not so good’ reviews, I always start with the positive aspects of our stay: 1.	The service at restaurant was exceptional; staff were very well trained, and the food was so delicious. The restaurant manager, Mr Senthil Kumar was always on the ground, and I think this made all the difference.. 2.	The concierge/ bell boys were also very helpful and go out of the way to assist us. The best part is, we had the feeling that their service was sincere and rendered without much expectations... We travelled as a big group (7 adults in 3 rooms), and had several unpleasant encounters and I will fault the hotel management for this : 1.	Upon checking in, we were given free…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Just above average,3,"I rate this hotel just above average. For a Hyatt property it can do better.   The location is good. For some strange reason only men are subjected to security checks while women can walk in without any checks.   Check in and check out was smooth and fast. The room was way below average. The toilet was not clean. The curtains are shabby and don’t work well. The hooks and railing need to be fixed. No welcome fruit basket.  The food and service is good even though a bit pricy for Chennai. The wine list is only imported wine and very expensive. It is cheaper to drink in London paying in pounds!  And finally, just unacceptable is the cost of airport transfer. More than 10 times the normal Uber cost for an Innova ride is not the best way to end your stay.  Doubt I will return…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,"If this is the #2 hotel, Chennai is in trouble",3,"Summary: if you are a frequent traveller and used to a high standard of quality, do not stay here. If you are an infrequent traveller that is not too picky, this place should be fine for you.  Review: This can't possibly be the 2nd best hotel in Chennai and is definitely and not up to standards for Radisson Blu. If you've been to their locations in Europe, you'll be surprised this is allowed to be called a Radisson Blu.  On the good side, the beds are very comfortable, the staff is accomodating, and the lunch buffet was tasty.  On the not so good side, the rooms are musty, poorly cleaned over the years (my shower had mildew that looked like it had been there for years), and tired. I had 2 different rooms and both were of equally poor quality, so I don't think it was an anomoly.…"

The Park Chennai,Better to lower star rating to 3,3,"I have stayed in Room No : 1009 on 12th Nov.  1. As soon as i got down from the car, I really didn't know where to go. No one was there to greet us and to open those two big doors. We figured that out by looking at others. 2. There were lot of people waiting to Check in. At this time, no one was there to greet and to ask us to have welcome drink. 3. Water was leaking from bathroom glass to bedroom. Lot of inconvenience. We had to put lot of towels. No response, when i called '9' on phone. I had demonstrated this to duty manager at the time of checkout. He accepted it as a failure. 4. While we were down to have breakfast, no one is there to greet us and to show place to sit.  we had to wait for 10 min and asked on going waiter. 5. Just 10 min after we checked into the room, one…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Mixed Opinion,3,"With a view to accommodate my newly wed daughter and son-in-law in a top-class centrally located hotel, I had booked them from 18th Nov, 2016 evening to 23rd Nov, 2016 morning.  While the hotel staff strived to provide hospitality and convenience, the ambience is a bit impersonal. The floor boy who conducted us to the room did not bother to explain the conveniences and facilities within the room leaving us to explore and discover.  Within minutes of checking into the room, we were received by cockroaches about which we intimated to the house keeping. No one responded. When the guests experienced it again the second day, they had to forcefully lodge a complaint followed by pest control spraying in the presence of the guests.  On the day prior to checking out, my daughter (who was…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Decent value for money,3,"I stayed for a night while en route to elsewhere on 17.03.2014. The airport pick-up and drop-in services were on-time and comfortable. Check-in and check-out were efficiently handled. The room service was prompt and to the point.   However, the service in the brunch buffet at Garden Cafe was the poorest I've experienced when comparable to restaurants of equal repute, being staffed with quite young chaps who looked and sounded clueless. The ambience was ruined by a bunch of ""newly-employed-in-IT-and-not-so-well-behaved"" clientele who seemd to have fasted for days just for this occassion and not have regards for other clients. Well, I'm no one to judge them, but my suggestion is to increase the prices two-fold.  The dinner at the 24 hour restaurant/cafe near the lobby was a…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Hyatt Quality in India,3,There is always a differs in India if any brand hotel if you know from your past experiences. You can not find same standards in India. Like smells and humidity effects. But this is India and if you there you have to taste this. I believe Hyatt Regency is the best choice you can find in Chennai. In the lobby there is an ordinary bar but you may consider it is best of Chennai.  Chinese restaurant at lobby is great but be carefull if you are not familiar to extreme chilly food. Also open and wide city view from windows…

The Park Chennai,Bad experience related to service at Park,3,My wife loves the Tiramisu dessert served at 601 cafe in The Park Chennai. We used to make it a point to visit at least once a month for this dessert. But for the last 3 visits we have been highly dissappointed with the service in general. Whenever we went this particular dessert was not available. Once we had gone with a group of friends as we had highly recommended this dessert but to our embarrassment it was not available. A hotel of this calibur should atleast ensure that they have sufficient quantities of dessert to last atleast for the day. I would now be thinking twice before I go to The Park or probably find a new place for our late night desserts.…

The rooms are great especially the ITC one or towers category,  A lot of options for the restaurants, a good gym. It’s a great feeling to stay here but the service is pathetic.......  Have stayed here at least 2 times in last 1 month and the biggest disappointment is that with each successive visit, the service and quality has gone down, But that’s been the trend with ITC , they somehow manage to get the service down for the in house guests....

But their breakfast spread is a bit of a disappointment especially for the pricing.  It was overall a really pleasant stay. The only annoying element was at the time of check-in, they take a picture of their guests which I found unnecessary and despite telling the guy that we were uncomfortable with the action, the guy went ahead. It makes no sense why why would do that given that there are IDs already with our pictures, the logic was that people could claim they are staying in your room which was a very alarming thing to hear that is even possible to happen at a hotel of their scale. Given all the cameras on the floor, wouldn't it be easy to find out…"

They are pretty standard, so dont leave a mark on the patron.. front desks can be a bit more efficient or there should be more people on the front desk, and the corridors and the carpets should be cleaner.   Service is very good though, but that is now expected of most hotels in this range too.  Bed was comfortable, the ac worked well and the room looked in ship shape. So from the inside, there was no problem. Room service was efficient and food tasted good. View - nothing to boast about. I had stayed in room 8302.  There are some good deals for patrons though.

I called up the restaurant reservation to inquire about the buffet options and possibility of a corporate discount. I didn't get a call for 15 minutes and I was told that we tried your number twice but no one picked. Indeed some problem with the phones.  The question is when a guest comes to stay for one night, he shouldn't be expected to get your housekeeping issues resolved.

Hilton Chennai,An intimidating building,3,Went for a conference only so there was not much that I could comment on  .   How strangely un-Hilton like  this was!!

Most Asian need ablutions after using the loo for cultural and religious reasons . The Hilton  public toilets did not have a hand held shower. Strange indeed? is this the same in other hotels as well?   The food except the paneer and kheer was so so.   And their chocolate chip cookies are no better than the the usual commercial offerings.…

The room we stayed had a muggy smell , probably from the air conditioning. The breakfast served was really bad. The idlis very spoilt and the dosa was very ordinary. The service overall was good and the staff are able to anticipate our needs . …"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not upto Hyatt standards but convenient location and comfortable rooms,3,"I have  been in other Hyatt hotels in Delhi and Mumbai but this one doesn't meet the overall standards:  1. Room: We got an excellent room but it had some housekeeping issues like bath-tub drain was clogged. Despite calling the house-keeping staff twice, it remained like that until next morning with clogged water in it. 2. Other hotel services - Travel desk was excellent. Driver Satya was one of the best drivers I have met in terms of hospitality. They arranged for my US visa embassy transfers very efficiently. Pool was very nice and well-maintained. Lobby and reception services could have been better. As soon as a guest comes to check-in, they look for a reception. For some reasons, the lobby area was extremely crowded and looked like a railway station as there is not enough…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not the best at that price point!,3,"Well, the hotel is situated right in the middle of the city. Some how, unlike my other Hyatt experiences, this was pretty average. There were many people as their reception staffs, yet they took more than 30 minutes to get my room, which was prepaid! They lacked attitude and training. And after reaching the room with the luggage, it was found that the key was not programmed - again go back to reception, wait, get it programmed and finally opened the door after a neat 30+ minutes. The room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was huge with a nice tub. The TV lacked choices of channels and bed was nice. I didn't try any of the foods, including breakfast and hence no comments. The check out was just ok, which took 10 minutes again! In one sentence, barring the front desk…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Wedding night stay,3,"Single liner: Nothing special to say about the stay and hospitality. Everything is standard for a 5 star hotel. Detailed review:Grand hotel, well maintained property. Suite that we stayed was Chola suite. It was huge and well maintained as per the standards. No his and her wash sinks though. We kept our preferences open with the team, but our hotel experience never made us feel special and all. It was rather a normal, everyday stay. Not even a welcome drink was served. Suite wasn't welcoming for a newly wedded couple. We understand that no floral arrangements can be made on the bed as it will spoil the linen, but no other place in the suite was made up special for newly wedded couple. Underwhelming experience when you are going for special day or occasion. So we decided not to…"

I hotel ambiance is not so great and I came to know that this is of bolly wood theme with few old movie posters here and there and in the hotel rooms as well.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Not such a great visit this time ,3,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel within the space of 6 months. There are plenty of positives about this hotel but there are plenty of items that can be improved.   This hotel is huge and obviously things don't always go to plan, however for a 5 star hotel I expect service to be excellent.   This visit I was not left bottled water in the room each day without having to prompt the staff, had to wait 20 minutes in a near empty restaurant for my order to be taken and then wait nearly another 40 minutes for my omelette to appear. Whilst these are trivial items, the hotel is expensive and the service should be up to standard.   Now I did complain at the time about these items and my complaint was picked up swiftly by the management team and handled courteously and to…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Responsible Luxury with an irresponsible service.,3,"The first thing about ITC Grand Chola is that it is massive and looks and feels luxurious. It’s huge and yes you feel really good once you enter this beautiful piece of architecture..... The rooms are great especially the ITC one or towers category,  A lot of options for the restaurants, a good gym. It’s a great feeling to stay here but the service is pathetic.......  Have stayed here at least 2 times in last 1 month and the biggest disappointment is that with each successive visit, the service and quality has gone down, But that’s been the trend with ITC , they somehow manage to get the service down for the in house guests.... Have been a loyal customer with ITC for last 6 years and often feel they have lost the customer focus they had earlier...  It’s a good experience to come…"

The Park Chennai,"Standard 3.5 star hotel, rooms good, sleep good, can clean up the corridors better",3,"The Park hotels in other cities than Kolkata can learn a thing or two from its peer. They are pretty standard, so dont leave a mark on the patron.. front desks can be a bit more efficient or there should be more people on the front desk, and the corridors and the carpets should be cleaner.   Service is very good though, but that is now expected of most hotels in this range too.  Bed was comfortable, the ac worked well and the room looked in ship shape. So from the inside, there was no problem. Room service was efficient and food tasted good. View - nothing to boast about. I had stayed in room 8302.  There are some good deals for patrons though. The buffet lunch @1100 is well worth its cost, and the restaurant seemed empty enough for you to enjoy it in peace. There were some…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Short break ,3,"We chose Hyatt primarily because of location and having heard about the hotel, but it wasn't the best of experience. Check in at 10:30 pm took long enough to frustrate us. Front desk staff untrained and unaware of basics of cc usage. Excellent housekeeping staff but a note for management, Chennai being humid, staff need to use deodorants as they smell. Entire corridor was smelling of staleness and when we highlighted to lobby manager, we were informed they were aware and working on it. We realised its a perpetual problem, hence be prepared. Helpful concierge staff. Check out was again a nightmare because of untrained cashier.…"
The Park Chennai,A Hotel desperately in need of modernization!,3,"This is one of the older star hotels in Chennai and has an enviable location - bang in the heart of the city, close to many offices, shopping areas, restaurants, consulates etc. However, the overall quality of the hotel has gone down over the years and it would be great if the management took cognizance of this and renovated/modernized the hotel.  Checkin was a bit slow. The room that i got had a door that did not close properly and the phone receiver had a musty smell. The room was also rather small and dark. Later, they moved me to another bigger room on a smoking floor. Thankfully, I did not get the smoke smell inside my room.  Room service was okay. Service at the BF buffet was downright sad.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Great hotel - Very poor customer service!,3,The hotel itself is excellent but the staff needs to get their act together if they really want to keep up with the stature that this hotel represents!  I was traveling on business and had booked airport pickup and have a confirmation email from the hotel (email confirmation from Arish R) - this was done at least 2 week prior to my actual travel. No one showed up at the airport and I was later by the front desk that the pickup request was not attached to my reservation even though the email confirmed both the room and car reservations.  I contacted Nadeem Khan and Meghna Rao (Front Desk manager and Travel Manager) twice via email but did not get any response back from them!  The lack of a response/acknowledgement was what bothered me more than the screw up with the airport…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Disappointing compared to earlier stays,3,"Stayed for 3 nights in Towers category room in second week of December.  The reservation experience is one of the worst I had ever experienced.It's a struggle to make reservation at this place. This is a recurring incident and surprisingly not resolved yet.  The place is huge and has been a benchmark in terms of service, food quality and grand ambience.  The breakfast buffet continues to be one of the best with wide variety of options however hospitality was disappointing compared to earlier set standards and experience.  The towers room size was very spacious with good wifi connectivity and iPad operated experience.  The residents lounge at ground floor was always full ...possibly due to imbalance in number of guests and size of lunge.Needs improvement.The other residents…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",big name small gain,3,"I was at Lemon Tree, Chennai on a business visit and dinner for a day. The experience was not good.  The rooms were slow to be allotted and even slower to be cleaned apparently. Check-in took time and so did the room service.  Their restaurant is small and has a limited buffet and a la carte menu. We had the vegetarian buffet and the quality of food was way below what one would expect for the money charged.  Give it a miss if you can manage to get in some other hotel.…"

The check-in, the  reception etc all are very good, however the odd part is  the room Aircon system.  It is  preset  by the Hotel at 22 deg C, and  There was no way I could change it to my comfort level.22 was  hot  for me  at that time of the year  and I  didnt  quite get to sleep  at all.

Taj Club House,Fish smelt like fish,3,"I was transiting via Chennai in the middle of the night and needed to get some food (because Chennai airport is hopeless). That's how and why I ended up at Taj Club House at 4am. There was only one single guest in the whole ground floor of the hotel - me. It was a bit spooky. How old is this place anyway? I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest. I'm not sure what the story of the hotel is, but I think I need to return during the day to see if it's going to be a different scene.…"

GreenPark Chennai,Misleading 5*,3,"We booked this hotel after being recommended by our friends who had recently stayed for a wedding.   The hotel itself is located opposite a mall, very convenient if your trip involves shopping, eating nice food and there are places in the mall to entertain kids.   Room: The room is very much out dated and in need of an up-lift. I knew this already through the pictures on trip advisor, however I was under the impression that it would be very clean still.  On the day of arrival, they were exceptionally good in providing us with a room earlier than the usual check in time. As I removed the duvet from the bed to put my very tired kids to bed after a 24 hour journey to India, I noticed so many small hair on the bed. It was digusting! And started to wonder what else they Jang changed…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Every picture tells a story,3,We have just stayed at this hotel and it quite simply is not 5 star. We moved from the ITC Hotel where we were very happy but we had previously planned to move to the Hyatt due to the fact they advertised washer/dryer. After much travelling we needed to wash our clothes in a washing machine! It turned out the washer/dryer advertised was the sink in the bedroom and the hair dryer!!! During our needless stay we were constantly itchy with our skin being Irritated by dust. We asked for a deep clean for our bedroom but it didn't improve. You will see from the pics I was bitten extensively in my bed on the last night. Swimming pool was in poor repair as you can see! Plus points was the airport liaison manager and the staff at the front door and the beautiful lobby. I hate complaining…
The Park Chennai,Bad experience related to service at Park,3,My wife loves the Tiramisu dessert served at 601 cafe in The Park Chennai. We used to make it a point to visit at least once a month for this dessert. But for the last 3 visits we have been highly dissappointed with the service in general. Whenever we went this particular dessert was not available. Once we had gone with a group of friends as we had highly recommended this dessert but to our embarrassment it was not available. A hotel of this calibur should atleast ensure that they have sufficient quantities of dessert to last atleast for the day. I would now be thinking twice before I go to The Park or probably find a new place for our late night desserts.…

GreenPark Chennai,A mixed-up review! ,3,"Have been to this place twice recently for wedding receptions. Once u get inside of the front gate, the space,ambience & food are all SUPERLATIVE.  What has to be mentioned is the trip to that front gate. Signage is very very bad! The board is not clearly visible from either side. Travelling 8-10kms for a reception, around 90% was covered in less than half-hour. The rest took another 45-50mnts! Traffic is just HORRENDOUS!!! No traffic signal or policemen to help.  Wish there will be some speedy solution to this! …"

Hilton Chennai,The God is in the details...this one missed out on certain key parameters!!!,3,"So, its a fine property. But when it comes to a 5 star property, the expectations are huge and you cannot afford to miss out on the smaller but important details. All 3 telephones in my room had a buzz sound throughout and the voice clarity was completely missing. The internet didn't work and was giving some error. I called up the restaurant reservation to inquire about the buffet options and possibility of a corporate discount. I didn't get a call for 15 minutes and I was told that we tried your number twice but no one picked. Indeed some problem with the phones.  The question is when a guest comes to stay for one night, he shouldn't be expected to get your housekeeping issues resolved. None of these things were so important that I should have called up someone to get this…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Average experience with some bright spots,3,"We had the most pathetic and Horrible check-in experience at ITC Grand Chola, and our sole reason to have had stayed at the hotel was Mr Amarnath (Duty Manager). It was because of his sole endeavour to address our grievance promptly and put in the corrective measures in place that we stayed at the property for 3 nights. Being a Taj Epicure member and have stayed at most premium hotels (Including ITC ones) in India and Abroad I can say that we never had worst experience at arrival anywhere else. The entire process of Luggage. Room allocation. staff courteousness at the welcome desk had been a nightmare. At arrival, there was no courteousness in the staff to offer a glass of water though there were quite many ladies standing and chatting. finally, after a wait of 20 mins, i asked…"

The Park Chennai,Avoidable Overpriced Hotel,3,"Very disappointing place. I believe the Hotel was built on an earlier Gemini Studio property. The corridors and rooms are lined with old movie posters. Unfortunately, it gives the entire place some very gloomy, seedy looks. Owners seem to have cut corners while designing the rooms. Toilets have just been squeezed into the rooms. Furniture looks cheap.  Ironically, I had stayed at the Hyatt the previous night and shifted here next night due to its proximity to my workplace. And the contrast could not have been starker.  I would recommend going for any other 5 stars in Chennai as this hotel is no comparison to the rest even though its pricing is nearly similar to Hyatt's. The only consolation was the Breakfast spread which was not too lavish but still ofacceptable quality.…"

Most irritating is lots of trainees in all Dept. The guy supposed to escort me while checking in - couldn't find my room without my help. Even in BFAST -- lot of trainees who don't know what to do; HOW is the next Q.   They don't follow the simple rule- A LEARNER should always be accompanied with an instructor.  And there was mosquito in the room - informed to HK and Ms Sapna ( front office) too. But nothing happened.  If you call up IRD - it's ENGAGED most of the time for some reason.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Billing at Front Desk a mess,3,"ITC normally has a high standard of professionalism but this Hotel does not come up to that. For example in billing there is a serious problem. The coffee shop took so long to get the bill , despite repeated requests one noon time that we had to start walking out. More seriously ,the room was being paid for by us through the travel agent who had given us a voucher, which explicitly covered the third bed. Despite that more than half an hour was wasted at the time of check out because Reception insisted on charging us for the third bed , before it could be sorted out.  A large Hotel need not be confusing but this one with 600 rooms and 4 lobbies is, at the moment  The rooms are nice and the food is good…"

The Park Chennai,Worth 3.5 stars,3,"Stayed here in January 2021 when  Covid related travel restrictions have made safety an utmost priority    Location:  Right off the Gemini bridge exactly at the 'Heart of Chennai', a hotel cannot have a better location.  Safety: The hotel tries to maintain safety standards - rooms are sanitized and clean, and so are the public areas.. but the rules followed by other five star hotels are much stricter..  for example: Here, At the entrance, your luggage is neither checked nor sanitized, The entrance doors by themselves are not Covid safety friendly - since hundreds of hands push them on a daily basis- not sure how often the entrance handles are sanitized, the  step on sanitizer dispensers at a couple of places werent working properly, masks did not seem to be mandatory for guests…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Big and bland,3,"I'm an SPG Platinum member, who used to stay at the old ITC Chola - due to its proximity to the centre of Chennai, and then at the ITC Park Sheraton.  I have been looking forward to returning to Chennai and staying at the ITC Grand Chola for a long time.  The photos looked huge and grand and imposing, and I anticipated it being something very special. Unfortunately, when I did stay I found it huge, and grand, but ultimately underwhelming.  Perhaps it is possible to make something too large, and too marble, too vast, but take away that special quality that gives the hotel life and soul and interest.  Make no mistake, this is a huge hotel.  Apparently the third largest in India. It has an entrance on every side - which they make sure you are aware of by unneccessarily making taxis…"
The Park Chennai,Good location,3,I stayed here for a night on Feb 8th 2012. As I had a late flight I reached the hotel quite late and was upgraded to a executive suite. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. The location of this hotel is great. I did find the paint from the walls peel off near the windows. The next day I was shifted to another room. The front desk called me a couple of times to know when I would be checking out from the executive suite. I found that to be annoying. The breakfast is good and the spread quite nice. They charge for the internet in the room which I think is not justified.  The room I was shifted to was a corner room and quite small.The bed was comfortable. Overall it was a decent experience but I expected more out of Park hotels.…

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not their usual level of service ,3,To begin with the check in was pretty slow. This was also due to some unruly guests who did not bring their ID proof with address and kept on barging in while the staff was doing my check in. But I thought the staff should have politely asked to them to wait rather than trying to manage both & not able to do that.   The room was small but comfortable with all the basic amenities present. The Wifi was fast & ensures that I finish my work fast.   I went to the swimming pool in the evening around 815 pm. It’s an open air pool and one of the smallest pool I have seen. The temperature of the water was very comfortable.  But I could see that the picture water was not clean as there were dust sediments floating over the water. Also the pool was completely unattended. While I was…
GreenPark Chennai,Beware of travel desk,3,"We stayed 05//03/2011 to 07/03/2011 this hotel. Let me first say that the rooms and bathrooms are spotless, the room service is top on. Our stay was most enjoyable until check out. When have friends living nearby Chennai that advised us to visit Mahabalipuram (really recommendable). When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the travel desk to book an excursion. They had a 10h excursion on offer at reasonable price. We, however, didn't have any interest in visiting a crocodile park etc. and asked for a price to just go for 1/2 day to see the temples. They were initially totally infexible but eventually agreed and at a lesser price. They insisted it takes 2 1/2 h one way, while we know it's about 1 1/2h drive, which it was. The excursion, at the agreed price, was written into their…"
Taj Club House,Average hotel. Taj experience lacking. ,3,"We stayed at Taj Club House for 3 nights recently. To begin with, the hotel did not have the feel of a Taj property. Even though it was Christmas time, the hotel looked dull. The rooms had hard beds and average interiors. We weren't that comfortable with such hard mattress so asked our room to be changed. This process took more than 24 hours and after that we were told that all rooms have the same mattress. Coming to the service, whenever we asked for anything( bath towel, bath robe, coffee mugs etc), the housekeeping staff always got the things in lesser quantities than asked for. For e.g.single.towel, single mug, single dental kit  etc. The hotel is conveniently located near many commercial and shopping areas like T Nagar. However on my next visit I would prefer similar…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Wannabe Five Star Property!,3,They try very hard but this is not a five star property. At the most 4 stars. I would not stay here again. The check-in was smooth. The lobby is very unimpressive. The room is very averagely furnished. The bathroom area very badly designed. to get into the bath tub you need to go over a 16 inch thick wall. someone not very agile will injure himself or herself doing this. I was shocked to see a Squeezee Shower Gel and Shampoo Dispenser fitted on the wall a la Ibis! But Ibis has world class toiletries. This shower gel and shampoo reeked of coconut oil! Very pathetic toiletries for a Radisson in the garb of being eco friendly. The shower equipment was tough and jammed and leaking constantly. Very poor shower pressure. The air-conditioning was another horror story. The room…

The Park Chennai,Convenient location,3,My third stay in the hotel...over the years it looks a bit run judging by its external facade however just about manages to keep up with 5 star pretences on the inside.  Food and beverage seemed a bit on the pricier side judging by the room service menu listing.  I would rather step out of the hotel and eat at plenty of good stand alone restaurants in the walking vicinity...I would not only save a substantial amount of money for the organisation but would also shed some calories.  If a bit adventurous the anjappar restaurant in the vicinity serves some mean chettinad food…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",BAD LOCATION,3,"However the is Property might be good but reaching there is really tough, The Hotel is in such a location that it becomes pracitically tough to reach from any side of chennai city. The Traffic to reach this hotel has made me so tired that next time I will never think of going to this hotel. Belive me it has taken 45 min travel from Satyam theater to this hotel at snail pace of traffic for a distance of 5km abd once your enter the hotel the only grand thing is the lobby level other then that nothing much to say, there are only two fresh rooms avaible at the both ends of the banquets which are very far away , one has to walk some hundreds of meters to reach.

The Park Chennai,A NOT TO BE A STAR HOTEL,3,The Park is centrally located but it has too many deficiencies be it the décor of rooms far from sat or having seepage.

GreenPark Chennai,Nice property,3,"Pretty nice property. Spacious rooms. Really clean and well maintained hotel. The food is pretty good at once upon a time. But their breakfast spread is a bit of a disappointment especially for the pricing.  It was overall a really pleasant stay. The only annoying element was at the time of check-in, they take a picture of their guests which I found unnecessary and despite telling the guy that we were uncomfortable with the action, the guy went ahead. It makes no sense why why would do that given that there are IDs already with our pictures, the logic was that people could claim they are staying in your room which was a very alarming thing to hear that is even possible to happen at a hotel of their scale. Given all the cameras on the floor, wouldn't it be easy to find out…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Hotel with a Grand Look,3,"The Hotel does not live up to it's star rating. On entry one gets hit by a crowded area full of people who are non residents and have come to attend a conference....very unusual for a residential hotel. The check in was good however, we did not realize that we were upgraded (as per the check in executive) to a serviced apartment from the main hotel....we should have checked the upgrade before accepting it as the services in the apartment area were average (room amenities eg the service booklets were old, the room delivery of water was left outside the door and not even handed over, no room turn down etc. The SPA services are great.

Taj Club House,Restaurant review only - disappointed,3,"This review is only for the restaurant, not the hotel. Disappointed: That is the word that we came out with. Had gone for a business lunch and ordered the buffet. Previous day, called for table booking, no answer from the restaurant, so was transferred to Table Bookings. They took my details but could not answer my questions, promised to call me back. Never got the call back and neither was our booking sent to the restaurant. Landed the next day without reservation but were lucky to get table. Buffet is only for soups, salads and dessert, and you are allowed to order one main course from the menu. One veg and one non veg soup, about 5 veg and 5 non veg pre prepared salads. Additional salad counter with veg salad items for mix n match. No starters at all. Compared to other…"
The Park Chennai,Leaves a bit to be desired,3,"Cesar Ritz said that the location is the most important thing for a hotel...by that count, The Park, Chennai has its location bang on. The hotel is located on Mount Road/Anna Salai in central Chennai and is close to everything. But the hotel itself is a mixed bag. The decor in the public areas is quite chic, though raucous weekend crowds spilling out from the Leather Bar into the ground floor guest lounge is irritating, to say the least. The rooms are acceptable-just. There is no storage space for baggage and clothes and of the couple of shelves in the closet, one is taken up by the safe. There is no provision to hang clothes-the shelf is not tall enough, unless it is a pair of shorts you want to hang up! The absence of adequate storage space in a hotel that is supposedly 5 star…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Luxurious but service needs to step up,3,"Stayed in grand chola for 2 days last months. It is a super luxurious hotel with fantastic rooms and as a SPG platinum member, got upgraded to a massive suite which was opulent & royal to say the least. However, service levels leave a lot to be desired. 3 separate incidents which illustrate the same  1. Ordered a cheddar cheese sandwich & they gave us with a different cheese and tried to push it when my wife said it was a different one 2. Smoke alarm in a smoking room went off and had to wait for 30 minutes for someone to come and fix it 3. Had to wait for 20 minutes to get the cheque in their coffee shop when there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant  For me, a 7 star hotel should have 7 star service and not just fancy rooms & massive halls.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Wedding night stay,3,"Single liner: Nothing special to say about the stay and hospitality. Everything is standard for a 5 star hotel. Detailed review:Grand hotel, well maintained property. Suite that we stayed was Chola suite. It was huge and well maintained as per the standards. No his and her wash sinks though. We kept our preferences open with the team, but our hotel experience never made us feel special and all. It was rather a normal, everyday stay. Not even a welcome drink was served. Suite wasn't welcoming for a newly wedded couple. We understand that no floral arrangements can be made on the bed as it will spoil the linen, but no other place in the suite was made up special for newly wedded couple. Underwhelming experience when you are going for special day or occasion. So we decided not to…"
GreenPark Chennai,Beware of travel desk,3,"We stayed 05//03/2011 to 07/03/2011 this hotel. Let me first say that the rooms and bathrooms are spotless, the room service is top on. Our stay was most enjoyable until check out. When have friends living nearby Chennai that advised us to visit Mahabalipuram (really recommendable). When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the travel desk to book an excursion. They had a 10h excursion on offer at reasonable price. We, however, didn't have any interest in visiting a crocodile park etc. and asked for a price to just go for 1/2 day to see the temples. They were initially totally infexible but eventually agreed and at a lesser price. They insisted it takes 2 1/2 h one way, while we know it's about 1 1/2h drive, which it was. The excursion, at the agreed price, was written into their…"

Service....considering it was during a conference... Not much to say... Food....the flagship Peshawar made THE best North Western food ever. The Madras pavilion decent....the coffee shop amazing desserts!!  Though we had visited the hotel umpteen number of times during the time we were based in Chennai....al of them good...the one stay was just OK!! …"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not their usual level of service ,3,To begin with the check in was pretty slow. This was also due to some unruly guests who did not bring their ID proof with address and kept on barging in while the staff was doing my check in. But I thought the staff should have politely asked to them to wait rather than trying to manage both & not able to do that.   The room was small but comfortable with all the basic amenities present. The Wifi was fast & ensures that I finish my work fast.   I went to the swimming pool in the evening around 815 pm. It’s an open air pool and one of the smallest pool I have seen. The temperature of the water was very comfortable.  But I could see that the picture water was not clean as there were dust sediments floating over the water. Also the pool was completely unattended. While I was…
The Park Chennai,Friendly and helpful but a bit run down,3,"We stayed in The Park for a weekend in Chennai to get over jet lag on the way to Kerala.  We had a special deal that gave us breakfast and free internet access.  However, for a nominally four-star hotel the rooms were relatively small and and a bit run down.  We did find a cockroach running around on the desk.  Although that is probably hard to avoid completely in a tropical climate, one would hope that this could be avoided in a four-star hotel.    The lobby is nice and spacious and the staff try to do their best to help but are not always very efficient.    The breakfast is buffet style and the selection is reasonable and, like many hotels in India, prepare an omelet to taste.  However, this was one of the best omelets that we had.  The tea and coffee come milky and…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good Bad and Ugly,3,"I stayed at the Hyatt Chennai for 2 nights. The hotel is beautiful, the art works are breath taking. The rooms are large and comfortable, no complaints. But it has the worst food that I have ever eaten in Chennai. The buffet meals at the conference were inedible, the room service food was below average. It was the cooking without passion. I ate 6 meals there, and obviously tried different dishes each time. Each dish was bad to very bad !!  Wondering what the chef is in a bad mood about.…"

Most irritating is lots of trainees in all Dept. The guy supposed to escort me while checking in - couldn't find my room without my help. Even in BFAST -- lot of trainees who don't know what to do; HOW is the next Q.   They don't follow the simple rule- A LEARNER should always be accompanied with an instructor.  And there was mosquito in the room - informed to HK and Ms Sapna ( front office) too. But nothing happened.  If you call up IRD - it's ENGAGED most of the time for some reason. I have asked the GUEST SERVICE - to arrange a call back, but they…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Poor customer relations,3,"This feedback is following today's incident over booking a table at 'Peshawari' at the ITC grand chola, Chennai.  On calling the desk for the reservation to be made, I was informed that I would get a call back in a few minutes to after checking to confirm, after 45 minutes and after NO call from the hotel, I call back only to hear the staff from the other end telling me that the staff in question IS IN A MEETING!  Now, this is certainly not the response anyone would expect from a 5/7 star rated hotel, not to mention from the ITC group!  This is the second time this has happened in the span of 1 week! The sheer experience of dining at the ITC brand is ruined!  If this is the training the staff attending the phones have received, one can only imagine how horrible the other…"

And it took multiple reminders for it to finally get to our room  Room - Pretty nice. Sore points - The shower stalls needed a good scrub. The joints had black stains from water, soap and other grime! Pretty gross for a Hyatt. I would say that housekeeping - maintenance of bathrooms is poor.  Restaurant - We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was nice. But, the service was disappointing. We never got several of orders from the live counters. They were just overwhelmed with a half full restaurant.  Valet - Attentive and helpful.

Taj Club House,Fish smelt like fish,3,"I was transiting via Chennai in the middle of the night and needed to get some food (because Chennai airport is hopeless). That's how and why I ended up at Taj Club House at 4am. There was only one single guest in the whole ground floor of the hotel - me. It was a bit spooky. How old is this place anyway? I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest. I'm not sure what the story of the hotel is, but I think I need to return during the day to see if it's going to be a different scene.…"

The Park Chennai,1 night stay,3,"I had stayed overnight between a hectic business meeting. I found the hotel to be very slow. I found many things not upto the mark. I had sent in my luggage in the morning, but when I reached late in the night, exhausted, I had to wait for a long time to only give my photo id. There were inadequate staff manning the counters as the staff were decent and helpful. In the room itself, there was 1 cup for making tea and no spoon. The morning breakfast experience was the worst. It appeared that the ""Complimentary breakfast"" was treated as a compliment by the staff. I got a table and had to ask for cutlery, water, napkin. Items like vada was over even at 9.00 am and came in after a very long time. I ordered a cup of coffee and had to remind the staff many times over 20 minutes for the…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Claims to be 5 Star, but 3 Star at best.",3,"I stayed in January for over three weeks.  After looking at the website and amenities I was very excited to stay at this hotel.  I had a few great experiences and more than a few frustrating experiences.  So the good.  The spa is fantastic!  Wait staff at the upstairs bars are fantastic.  The lobby and grand staircase are amazing.  Peshwari is fantastic.  The not so good.  The front desk is understaffed and slow.  It took a while to check in.  I checked in around 6am, set the do not disturb signs and was awakened at 10, at 2, and at 4 with demands to clean the room.  Blatant disregard for signage.

We couldn’t have breakfast and all they could pack for us on request was a packed juice and croissants sans tte promised veg-cheese sandwich. We had to get out early as we were flying to Andamans.

However, the service in the brunch buffet at Garden Cafe was the poorest I've experienced when comparable to restaurants of equal repute, being staffed with quite young chaps who looked and sounded clueless.

The Park Chennai,Bad experience related to service at Park,3,My wife loves the Tiramisu dessert served at 601 cafe in The Park Chennai. We used to make it a point to visit at least once a month for this dessert. But for the last 3 visits we have been highly dissappointed with the service in general. Whenever we went this particular dessert was not available. Once we had gone with a group of friends as we had highly recommended this dessert but to our embarrassment it was not available. A hotel of this calibur should atleast ensure that they have sufficient quantities of dessert to last atleast for the day. I would now be thinking twice before I go to The Park or probably find a new place for our late night desserts.…

Pre election I felt a warm attentive feel around the hotel the bar food and restaurant were superb and well presented  During the election there were clearly more important persons staying and the focus completely left the regular CustomerCare very much a bowing and scraping approach to these attendees and no one else really mattered  During the campaigns the bars were closed or dry during election same thing. So really very little quality during that month   The breakfast and pool area was well provided for and maintained all through with good snacks available   I also remember taxi access was slow and security unnecessarily complex and…

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Just Average..,3,"I was in Chennai for a business meeting so decided to stay at the Lemon Tree Hotel for a night. I was with a colleague and I must say that our collective experience was average, at best. First, check-in took more than 30 minutes as the guys at the reception made several mistakes in room assignments and ultimately had to keep us waiting to sort the rooms out. Service at the restaurant was equally average as the waiters were simply not too interested in customer service. The only good thing for me was the room itself. Was neat and comfortable. Overall Service was average.  Having said that, I wont hesitate to add that Lemon tree is a good brand judging from my experience in other locations especially Bangalore. I think they just need to bring the Chennai hotel up to their standard.…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,OK But Not Number 2 - Average Hotel,3,"Stayed here on a recent trip to India.  The hotel is close to the airport but I would not consider this to be a number 2 hotel or a 5* property.  It was just average to above average in my books.  The room was very well stocked with everything you needed etc. but just not at the 5* level.  Price was certainly cheaper.  That said, but for having to be at the airport for a 6am flight to Kochi (and it was nice to be very very close), we would have stayed at the Taj Coromandel.  Also, was there just as the second monsoon started this past October.  I did notice there was a considerable issue with mosquitos (including in the hotel), perhaps an issue noticed in Chennai generally.  It was just average in my books and between 3-4* in terms of North Amercia standards.  Buffet was just…"

Indian hotel staff still have a long way to go. Rooms have some classic furniture but the cleanliness needs to go up a bit and the carpets on the corridor look tired.   Went to the spa, the hostess was lovely and the treatment option we had involved a 90 min massage. The girls were Mizo but spoke reasonable english. The massage was a bit of a cross between thai and ayurvedic approach. The girls were professional but relatively inexperienced.You know the masseur is good when your body says so. This wasn't.

The Park Chennai,Friendly and helpful but a bit run down,3,"We stayed in The Park for a weekend in Chennai to get over jet lag on the way to Kerala.  We had a special deal that gave us breakfast and free internet access.  However, for a nominally four-star hotel the rooms were relatively small and and a bit run down.  We did find a cockroach running around on the desk.  Although that is probably hard to avoid completely in a tropical climate, one would hope that this could be avoided in a four-star hotel.    The lobby is nice and spacious and the staff try to do their best to help but are not always very efficient.    The breakfast is buffet style and the selection is reasonable and, like many hotels in India, prepare an omelet to taste.  However, this was one of the best omelets that we had.  The tea and coffee come milky and…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,An unexpected- average experience,3,"We arrived in Chennai at early hours and checked in by 4 am. Surprisingly, they do not have paid early checkin facility. We had to pay for 2 nights even if we were checking out at 6.30, next day. We couldn’t have breakfast and all they could pack for us on request was a packed juice and croissants sans tte promised veg-cheese sandwich. We had to get out early as we were flying to Andamans.  No value for money, rooms weren’t up to ‘Radisson’ standard.  Housekeeping staff and restaurant staff were nice. Overall, a big disappointment.…"
The Park Chennai,Good stay but service could have been better,3,"I stayed at THE PARK Chennai for two days. The rooms are nice and clean. Food is good and they do offer a variety to choose from. BUT, I was a bit disappointed at the service.  Firstly, water clogged up in wash basin. Not a good way to start with.  Secondly, the charger pins on one side of the bed was damaged. My phone charger would not plug in and when I plugged in my laptop charger, the entire room power was cut off..probably due to a short circuit. power was restored immediately though.  Then at the dining, I felt a bit ignored.  On first instance, I being alone choose to sit on a small table. After finishing off the starters, there wasn't any space left on the table to put a third plate. I got up and when came back, I was literally standing with main course in my hand and…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Highs and lows...,3,"Location - Mount Road, Cant beat it.  Checkin - Effecient, Warm [with a room upgrade to boot]  Luggage - Someone forgot to send it up to our room. And it took multiple reminders for it to finally get to our room  Room - Pretty nice. Sore points - The shower stalls needed a good scrub. The joints had black stains from water, soap and other grime! Pretty gross for a Hyatt. I would say that housekeeping - maintenance of bathrooms is poor.  Restaurant - We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was nice. But, the service was disappointing. We never got several of orders from the live counters. They were just overwhelmed with a half full restaurant.  Valet - Attentive and helpful. But, there could be a delay of 15+ minutes to fetch your car. I would recommend self parking if you are…"
The Park Chennai,1 night stay,3,"I had stayed overnight between a hectic business meeting. I found the hotel to be very slow. I found many things not upto the mark.

There were inadequate staff manning the counters as the staff were decent and helpful. In the room itself, there was 1 cup for making tea and no spoon. The morning breakfast experience was the worst. It appeared that the ""Complimentary breakfast"" was treated as a compliment by the staff. I got a table and had to ask for cutlery, water, napkin. Items like vada was over even at 9.00 am and came in after a very long time. I ordered a cup of coffee and had to remind the staff many times over 20 minutes for the…"

The rooms were comfortable and the I pad guide was very handy. The motion sensors of the night lamp in my room No 2428 had malfunctioned the first Night in that it kept flickering even when I was motionless. Resultantly I could not sleep the first Night.

The Park Chennai,Stones throw from US Consulate ,3,Two days stay was quite enjoyable. But my initial experience was poor. Check in was smooth and the room was nice. But I had reached 10PM and was looking for some food hence ordered room service- the number was not reachable even though the service was available till 12 midnight. 4 tries later when I asked to speak with duty manager they called me back and served me. It was 12 midnight by the time I got to sleep. The AC was cooling beyond 23 degrees so didn't get much sleep. Next day I had 8AM appointment to which I went half asleep.   But the experience after that was good. Very courteous staff. They were more than helpful.   Morning breakfast was very good spread. I didn't but you have to try their special tea.  The wall between the bedroom and bathroom is glass- so if you…
GreenPark Chennai,Good base for Chennai,3,"3 is slightly harsh, this should be a 3.5.    Stayed for 2 days while in Chennai.  Hotel is about 30-40min by taxi from the airport due to traffic.  Overall good value.   The rooms are very spacious with comfortable (firm) King size bed and pillows.  Cleanliness of the room could be improved though - bedside tables and desk tops could do with a proper clean / wipe.   Bathroom is spacious and clean.  Has a handheld shower and a rain shower - good water pressure.  however sometimes  jumps from hot to cooler water and back every now and then.    Large desk and complementary WiFi in the room could suit business travellers.  Hotel also seems quite popular for weddings.   Service is friendly but due to some language barriers not always efficient (especially telephone requests from…"
GreenPark Chennai,Yea but!!,3,A regular visitor from January to May this year both pre and post elections. I mentioned that because of the differences in experiences.  Pre election I felt a warm attentive feel around the hotel the bar food and restaurant were superb and well presented  During the election there were clearly more important persons staying and the focus completely left the regular CustomerCare very much a bowing and scraping approach to these attendees and no one else really mattered  During the campaigns the bars were closed or dry during election same thing. So really very little quality during that month   The breakfast and pool area was well provided for and maintained all through with good snacks available   I also remember taxi access was slow and security unnecessarily complex and…

The Park Chennai,"Standard 3.5 star hotel, rooms good, sleep good, can clean up the corridors better",3,"The Park hotels in other cities than Kolkata can learn a thing or two from its peer. They are pretty standard, so dont leave a mark on the patron.. front desks can be a bit more efficient or there should be more people on the front desk, and the corridors and the carpets should be cleaner.   Service is very good though, but that is now expected of most hotels in this range too.  Bed was comfortable, the ac worked well and the room looked in ship shape. So from the inside, there was no problem. Room service was efficient and food tasted good. View - nothing to boast about. I had stayed in room 8302.  There are some good deals for patrons though. The buffet lunch @1100 is well worth its cost, and the restaurant seemed empty enough for you to enjoy it in peace. There were some…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Every picture tells a story,3,We have just stayed at this hotel and it quite simply is not 5 star. We moved from the ITC Hotel where we were very happy but we had previously planned to move to the Hyatt due to the fact they advertised washer/dryer. After much travelling we needed to wash our clothes in a washing machine! It turned out the washer/dryer advertised was the sink in the bedroom and the hair dryer!!! During our needless stay we were constantly itchy with our skin being Irritated by dust. We asked for a deep clean for our bedroom but it didn't improve. You will see from the pics I was bitten extensively in my bed on the last night. Swimming pool was in poor repair as you can see! Plus points was the airport liaison manager and the staff at the front door and the beautiful lobby. I hate complaining…

Belive me it has taken 45 min travel from Satyam theater to this hotel at snail pace of traffic for a distance of 5km abd once your enter the hotel the only grand thing is the lobby level other then that nothing much to say, there are only two fresh rooms avaible at the both ends of the banquets which are very far away , one has to walk some hundreds of meters to reach.

Despite calling the house-keeping staff twice, it remained like that until next morning with clogged water in it. 2. Other hotel services - Travel desk was excellent.

Hilton Chennai,New hotel with all Euro mod cons and a good location,3,"Very helpful staff from the airport to the room make the initial experience a good one. The hotel is new and so is still relatively quiet, not for long as it is far better than some of the other chain hotels in the region. The rooms are well appointed and modern with all the usual features and services you need as a business traveller. The gym is fairly basic with a couple of running machines and bikes, not top spec but good enough to allow you to train. The roof top pool looks great but is so close to the bar that I doubt many will use it as quite public. The roof top bar is very well designed and laid out although the service was patchy. The 3rd floor bar and restaurants are very good, wide choice and friendly service. The air con was an issue in my 9th floor room as it really…"

The Park Chennai,Six O One is just another one,3,"I was looking for a riveting ambiance, some quiet and of course great food for my dinner with my son yesterday night. I thought The Park's restaurants will provide me all these as I was guided to its 24 hr restaurant Six O One.   The initial experience was very good as the polite lady at the entrance ushered us in and we chose what we thought was a amiable seat. The spread looked good with local, Indian, Chinese and international selections, a tempting corner full of desserts and a wide selection of salads. Near the buffet counter were lit a few terracotta ovens to cater to the demands for local dishes like Pongal and others. These fire places added character to the setting.  The sea food broth made a good beginning, but starters played truant as we had to wait for an age to be…"

The Park Chennai,A Hotel desperately in need of modernization!,3,"This is one of the older star hotels in Chennai and has an enviable location - bang in the heart of the city, close to many offices, shopping areas, restaurants, consulates etc. However, the overall quality of the hotel has gone down over the years and it would be great if the management took cognizance of this and renovated/modernized the hotel.  Checkin was a bit slow. The room that i got had a door that did not close properly and the phone receiver had a musty smell. The room was also rather small and dark. Later, they moved me to another bigger room on a smoking floor. Thankfully, I did not get the smoke smell inside my room.  Room service was okay. Service at the BF buffet was downright sad. All the waiters seemed to be in their own worlds and none gave attention to the…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Not such a great visit this time ,3,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel within the space of 6 months. There are plenty of positives about this hotel but there are plenty of items that can be improved.   This hotel is huge and obviously things don't always go to plan, however for a 5 star hotel I expect service to be excellent.   This visit I was not left bottled water in the room each day without having to prompt the staff, had to wait 20 minutes in a near empty restaurant for my order to be taken and then wait nearly another 40 minutes for my omelette to appear. Whilst these are trivial items, the hotel is expensive and the service should be up to standard.   Now I did complain at the time about these items and my complaint was picked up swiftly by the management team and handled courteously and to…"
The Park Chennai,Leaves a bit to be desired,3,"Cesar Ritz said that the location is the most important thing for a hotel...by that count, The Park, Chennai has its location bang on. The hotel is located on Mount Road/Anna Salai in central Chennai and is close to everything. But the hotel itself is a mixed bag. The decor in the public areas is quite chic, though raucous weekend crowds spilling out from the Leather Bar into the ground floor guest lounge is irritating, to say the least. The rooms are acceptable-just. There is no storage space for baggage and clothes and of the couple of shelves in the closet, one is taken up by the safe. There is no provision to hang clothes-the shelf is not tall enough, unless it is a pair of shorts you want to hang up! The absence of adequate storage space in a hotel that is supposedly 5 star…"
The Park Chennai,Avoidable Overpriced Hotel,3,"Very disappointing place. I believe the Hotel was built on an earlier Gemini Studio property. The corridors and rooms are lined with old movie posters. Unfortunately, it gives the entire place some very gloomy, seedy looks. Owners seem to have cut corners while designing the rooms. Toilets have just been squeezed into the rooms. Furniture looks cheap.  Ironically, I had stayed at the Hyatt the previous night and shifted here next night due to its proximity to my workplace. And the contrast could not have been starker.  I would recommend going for any other 5 stars in Chennai as this hotel is no comparison to the rest even though its pricing is nearly similar to Hyatt's. The only consolation was the Breakfast spread which was not too lavish but still ofacceptable quality.…"

His room was never changed to higher floors or other side of the hotel, in spite of a direct request from him.  2. Two of the reception staff were absolutely unprofessional... we do understand that one needs to say 'No' at times, But the body language / words used were quite unethical & unprofessional. The security staff at the gate / main entrance of the hotel were not attentive & valueing presence of a foreigner with us. Either we or own own car driver was doing a duty of guard to promptly open the car doors upon arrival.  Just to keep you…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Short break ,3,"We chose Hyatt primarily because of location and having heard about the hotel, but it wasn't the best of experience.

Excellent housekeeping staff but a note for management, Chennai being humid, staff need to use deodorants as they smell. Entire corridor was smelling of staleness and when we highlighted to lobby manager, we were informed they were aware and working on it. We realised its a perpetual problem, hence be prepared.

GreenPark Chennai,A mixed-up review! ,3,"Have been to this place twice recently for wedding receptions. Once u get inside of the front gate, the space,ambience & food are all SUPERLATIVE.  What has to be mentioned is the trip to that front gate. Signage is very very bad! The board is not clearly visible from either side. Travelling 8-10kms for a reception, around 90% was covered in less than half-hour. The rest took another 45-50mnts! Traffic is just HORRENDOUS!!! No traffic signal or policemen to help.  Wish there will be some speedy solution to this! …"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,A Mixed Bag,3,"Stayed recently for couple of nights. Arrived late in the evening and as luck would have it, got the room farthest from the lift! The room is pretty standard, as you would expect it to be. The lights were very dim for some reason.  Anyway, after a good night’s sleep it was time for shower. For some reason I could not get the water temperature right for more than 10 seconds continuously. It is either too HOT or too COLD and somehow refuses to stay in between. I have noticed this issue at several hotels but somehow the Radisson’s have a knack of it especially in India.   Tried the free foot massage. It was nice and soothing. The bar is OK and the beer great! The food quality is great especially when the chef can accede to your little demands like replacing the chicken with fish in…"

They took my details but could not answer my questions, promised to call me back. Never got the call back and neither was our booking sent to the restaurant. Landed the next day without reservation but were lucky to get table. Buffet is only for soups, salads and dessert, and you are allowed to order one main course from the menu.

Wait staff at the upstairs bars are fantastic.  The lobby and grand staircase are amazing.  Peshwari is fantastic.  The not so good.  The front desk is understaffed and slow.  It took a while to check in.  I checked in around 6am, set the do not disturb signs and was awakened at 10, at 2, and at 4 with demands to clean the room.  Blatant disregard for signage.

I received keys to another guest's room by mistake. Air conditioning often gives trouble. Mattresses are not the most comfortable.   What redeems this hotel is exceptional cuisine.

After beverage was served nobody came  back to check for the next order . Restaurant guest experience need to improve. People will always come to the property with an expectation   concierge and valet parking team delivered an outstanding customer service.  …
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Expensive Hotel with Average services,3,"I went to this hotel with positive expectations being the brand but at the end it was a quite an average experience . The location of the hotel is really good and important areas are within approach. The staff of the hotel is non cooperative and i found them little rude, not ready for any kind of help or adjustments. The restaurant facilities are average but the prizing of the basic things like water, tea etc. are extremely expensive beyond any justification.  The in room dining has very little options and buffet breakfast timing does not suite the early flight catchers . Hotel do not provide them with any other option. I hope to see and user friendly services if i stay in future.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Luxurious but service needs to step up,3,"Stayed in grand chola for 2 days last months. It is a super luxurious hotel with fantastic rooms and as a SPG platinum member, got upgraded to a massive suite which was opulent & royal to say the least. However, service levels leave a lot to be desired. 3 separate incidents which illustrate the same  1. Ordered a cheddar cheese sandwich & they gave us with a different cheese and tried to push it when my wife said it was a different one 2. Smoke alarm in a smoking room went off and had to wait for 30 minutes for someone to come and fix it 3. Had to wait for 20 minutes to get the cheque in their coffee shop when there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant  For me, a 7 star hotel should have 7 star service and not just fancy rooms & massive halls.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Great building and facilities but service is less than superb.,3,"Looks and ambience are much better than service. Occupancy was only at about fifty percent when we checked in. However, when our room air conditioner was not working, staff tried to tell us there weren't any rooms available and that we should wait to have them fix the ac. Also, we had to call them three times to check the AC. If they want to compete with other nice hotels in the area, they need to work on their hospitality services. They should take some lessons from the oberoi group (the building was supposed to be an oberoi property).…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Jan 2013 visit,3,"Visited for an overnight stay, came across an unhelpful front desk staff member - after a bit of nudging, sorted out some reservation mix up and manager apologised later when he got to know. Indian hotel staff still have a long way to go. Rooms have some classic furniture but the cleanliness needs to go up a bit and the carpets on the corridor look tired.   Went to the spa, the hostess was lovely and the treatment option we had involved a 90 min massage. The girls were Mizo but spoke reasonable english. The massage was a bit of a cross between thai and ayurvedic approach. The girls were professional but relatively inexperienced.You know the masseur is good when your body says so. This wasn't. Overall, the staff is compliant but not very customer friendly. Indian staff usually…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Clean, but lack of free Wifi is not good",3,"The hotel room is clean, reasonably spacious, with a desk for working. There was a kettle in the room and free bottled water. Reasonable breakfast. There was a gym which was OK. However, in this day and age, the lack of free Wifi is not ideal. You get free 2 blocks of 30 minutes each, so free Wifi for 1 hour. But you have to use all the 30 minutes up at once each time, otherwise it is forfeited. And the connection is slow and can cut out intermittently. The internet in the Business Centre is free if  you use the computers provided. There is no free Wifi in the Business Centre. On the 1 occasion that I used the computer, it cut off after 30 minutes and asked me to log in again using the login for the Wifi. I am not sure why they penalise people who do not book online, as it seems…"

The Park Chennai,Just average,3,"First of all it looks like its 3* hotel, interior design is poor and it is not maintained properly. At the entrance there is nobody to open the heavy door for you, so if you have heavy bags you have to do it all by yourself. When you enter reception loby there is some strange smell, its just not fresh... I was wondering how staff can stand there all day... Room furniture seems old and not cleaned properly. Bathroom also not so clean... and there is rust everywhere. It just seems like very old and never replaced. View from the window is scary, there is old abandoned building and also curtains can't open so you dont have to look at it. Breakfast is ok, room service food also, staff good but seems not so motivated... Overall this hotel needs big changes, refurbishing... Hope they…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",big name small gain,3,"I was at Lemon Tree, Chennai on a business visit and dinner for a day. The experience was not good.  The rooms were slow to be allotted and even slower to be cleaned apparently. Check-in took time and so did the room service.  Their restaurant is small and has a limited buffet and a la carte menu. We had the vegetarian buffet and the quality of food was way below what one would expect for the money charged.  Give it a miss if you can manage to get in some other hotel.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Grand Infrastructure.. Not so grand Service!,3,One look at the building from the outside and the inside and you immediately know why this place is called Grand Chola. My wife and me decided to stay her for our first anniversary. We stayed in a Tower room. Since the property is still under constructio we were driven all around it to get to reception from the entrance. But that was actually nice because it gives you a sense of how big this hotel really is. tower rooms have their own check-in and check-in was smooth. Our room wasn't ready on arrival and in the meantime we were given a tour of the hotel and its facilities. Some of the architecture is jaw dropping. We were then taken to our room and shown how everything was connected to the iPad. Lunch at Peshawri was absolutely mind blowing. Some of the best food I have ever…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nice hotel but pricey !,3,"This is a ""marbellous"" hotel and like one of the other reviewers said they have invested a lot in the building itself. One has to unnecessarily walk a lot through the marble corridors to reach one's room. To park the vehicle one has to take a ""parikrama"" around the hotel after seeing their four entrances!   We stayed in the Towers Room. A day prior to check-in we had requested an extra bed and they had assured us that they would keep it ready. After checking in it took a couple of phone calls and in-person visits to the Towers Reception to get the bed.  Everything in the room is controlled via the iPad including the lighting and there are a few glitches there as the lights behind the TV keeping turning themselves on and off.  The room rates are a bit expensive as the taxes add…"
Hilton Chennai,An intimidating building,3,Went for a conference only so there was not much that I could comment on  .   How strangely un-Hilton like  this was!! The first impression is that this is a large gloomy boxlike building with a dark lobby/ reception area.    The lobby staff is very nice however.  Most Asian need ablutions after using the loo for cultural and religious reasons . The Hilton  public toilets did not have a hand held shower. Strange indeed? is this the same in other hotels as well?   The food except the paneer and kheer was so so.   And their chocolate chip cookies are no better than the the usual commercial offerings.…

But their breakfast spread is a bit of a disappointment especially for the pricing.  It was overall a really pleasant stay. The only annoying element was at the time of check-in, they take a picture of their guests which I found unnecessary and despite telling the guy that we were uncomfortable with the action, the guy went ahead. It makes no sense why why would do that given that there are IDs already with our pictures, the logic was that people could claim they are staying in your room which was a very alarming thing to hear that is even possible to happen at a hotel of their scale. Given all the cameras on the floor, wouldn't it be easy to find out…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not a good first impression!,3,"I stayed at Hyatt Regency Chennai for 2 nights on a recent trip to India, and I was not at all impressed with the rooms. The hotel seems good, and the staff was ok. The hotel reception and centrally located main seating area is wonderfully designed, but I did not find the rooms on par with the rest of the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and designed well, but that's where all good things come to an end. In my suite, I always found tiny insects flying around. The sofa in the seating room had a massive stain and when I requested for it to be changed, the seat was just reversed so the stain was not visible. The restroom had water stagnation problem, and the stand-in shower door was missing all together. All of these problems were reported to the front-desk on day one, but they…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Just above average,3,"I rate this hotel just above average. For a Hyatt property it can do better.   The location is good. For some strange reason only men are subjected to security checks while women can walk in without any checks.   Check in and check out was smooth and fast. The room was way below average. The toilet was not clean. The curtains are shabby and don’t work well. The hooks and railing need to be fixed. No welcome fruit basket.  The food and service is good even though a bit pricy for Chennai. The wine list is only imported wine and very expensive. It is cheaper to drink in London paying in pounds!  And finally, just unacceptable is the cost of airport transfer. More than 10 times the normal Uber cost for an Innova ride is not the best way to end your stay.  Doubt I will return…"
The Park Chennai,Convenient location,3,My third stay in the hotel...over the years it looks a bit run judging by its external facade however just about manages to keep up with 5 star pretences on the inside.  Food and beverage seemed a bit on the pricier side judging by the room service menu listing.  I would rather step out of the hotel and eat at plenty of good stand alone restaurants in the walking vicinity...I would not only save a substantial amount of money for the organisation but would also shed some calories.  If a bit adventurous the anjappar restaurant in the vicinity serves some mean chettinad food…
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Wannabe Five Star Property!,3,They try very hard but this is not a five star property. At the most 4 stars. I would not stay here again. The check-in was smooth. The lobby is very unimpressive. The room is very averagely furnished. The bathroom area very badly designed. to get into the bath tub you need to go over a 16 inch thick wall. someone not very agile will injure himself or herself doing this. I was shocked to see a Squeezee Shower Gel and Shampoo Dispenser fitted on the wall a la Ibis! But Ibis has world class toiletries. This shower gel and shampoo reeked of coconut oil! Very pathetic toiletries for a Radisson in the garb of being eco friendly. The shower equipment was tough and jammed and leaking constantly. Very poor shower pressure. The air-conditioning was another horror story. The room…

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,OK But Not Number 2 - Average Hotel,3,"Stayed here on a recent trip to India.  The hotel is close to the airport but I would not consider this to be a number 2 hotel or a 5* property.  It was just average to above average in my books.  The room was very well stocked with everything you needed etc. but just not at the 5* level.  Price was certainly cheaper.  That said, but for having to be at the airport for a 6am flight to Kochi (and it was nice to be very very close), we would have stayed at the Taj Coromandel.  Also, was there just as the second monsoon started this past October.  I did notice there was a considerable issue with mosquitos (including in the hotel), perhaps an issue noticed in Chennai generally.  It was just average in my books and between 3-4* in terms of North Amercia standards.  Buffet was just…"

Room: We got an excellent room but it had some housekeeping issues like bath-tub drain was clogged. Despite calling the house-keeping staff twice, it remained like that until next morning with clogged water in it. 2. Other hotel services - Travel desk was excellent. Driver Satya was one of the best drivers I have met in terms of hospitality. They arranged for my US visa embassy transfers very efficiently. Pool was very nice and well-maintained. Lobby and reception services could have been better. As soon as a guest comes to check-in, they look for a reception. For some reasons, the lobby area was extremely crowded and looked like a railway station as there is not enough…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,A Mixed Bag,3,"Stayed recently for couple of nights. Arrived late in the evening and as luck would have it, got the room farthest from the lift! The room is pretty standard, as you would expect it to be. The lights were very dim for some reason.  Anyway, after a good night’s sleep it was time for shower. For some reason I could not get the water temperature right for more than 10 seconds continuously. It is either too HOT or too COLD and somehow refuses to stay in between. I have noticed this issue at several hotels but somehow the Radisson’s have a knack of it especially in India.   Tried the free foot massage. It was nice and soothing. The bar is OK and the beer great! The food quality is great especially when the chef can accede to your little demands like replacing the chicken with fish in…"

The Park Chennai,Good location,3,I stayed here for a night on Feb 8th 2012. As I had a late flight I reached the hotel quite late and was upgraded to a executive suite. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. The location of this hotel is great. I did find the paint from the walls peel off near the windows. The next day I was shifted to another room. The front desk called me a couple of times to know when I would be checking out from the executive suite. I found that to be annoying. The breakfast is good and the spread quite nice. They charge for the internet in the room which I think is not justified.  The room I was shifted to was a corner room and quite small.The bed was comfortable. Overall it was a decent experience but I expected more out of Park hotels.…

However, the service in the brunch buffet at Garden Cafe was the poorest I've experienced when comparable to restaurants of equal repute, being staffed with quite young chaps who looked and sounded clueless.

Yes, the rooms are well-appointed and you operate lights, TV, etc. with an in-room iPad. Yes, there are many restaurants to choose from.  But:  The rooms are so fussy with fixtures and doors and mirrors and furniture that I'm always bumping in to something.   You can't walk from the hotel to check out the local street scene. First you have to get out of the huge walled compound. Then it's on a busy street that is not friendly for pedestrians (even by Chennai standards).  It's so big that you get lost in the crowd. And there's always a crowd.  The over-the-top attitude is tiring. There's always a staff person in front of you. There are more toiletries in the room and added every day than anyone can…"

It was because of his sole endeavour to address our grievance promptly and put in the corrective measures in place that we stayed at the property for 3 nights. Being a Taj Epicure member and have stayed at most premium hotels (Including ITC ones) in India and Abroad I can say that we never had worst experience at arrival anywhere else. The entire process of Luggage. Room allocation. staff courteousness at the welcome desk had been a nightmare. At arrival, there was no courteousness in the staff to offer a glass of water though there were quite many ladies standing and chatting. finally, after a wait of 20 mins, i asked…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Excellent spa but poor service and unclean rooms,3,"Hotel has excellent spa and spa staff. Room service is inconsistent, slow and regularly items on menu are not available. Rooms are not cleaned well and items not replaced consistently and regularly. On Fridays and Saturdays, there is loud party music with no respect for hotel guests. Recommend spa but more like 3 star hotel overall experience.…"
The Park Chennai,Central but in need of renovation,3,"A reasonably priced and central located hotel ....But , the rooms really do need renovation , the A/C works but poorly , the hot water took forever to get to my room and the room smells stale and damp.  I loved the Big Doors and the entrance and the staff are very warm and welcoming .but the rest leaves a lot to be desired !…"
Taj Club House,well located,3,"Stayed here during June 2017 for two nights. the hotel is well located and our stay was pleasant. the bathrooms were very small and the rooms are in need of renovation. the spa and swimming pool were well kept, though i was disappointed not to find a children's pool for my little one. the hotel is walking distance from a mall and room service is prompt.…"
The Park Chennai,Friendly and helpful but a bit run down,3,"We stayed in The Park for a weekend in Chennai to get over jet lag on the way to Kerala.  We had a special deal that gave us breakfast and free internet access.  However, for a nominally four-star hotel the rooms were relatively small and and a bit run down.  We did find a cockroach running around on the desk.  Although that is probably hard to avoid completely in a tropical climate, one would hope that this could be avoided in a four-star hotel.    The lobby is nice and spacious and the staff try to do their best to help but are not always very efficient.    The breakfast is buffet style and the selection is reasonable and, like many hotels in India, prepare an omelet to taste.  However, this was one of the best omelets that we had.  The tea and coffee come milky and…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Nothing Exciting,3,Business hotel with good location but lacked the wow factor. I was charged 4k for a room which was ordinary with limited space to roam around. The buffet dinner charges 999/- are on the higher side with not much in the menu. The reception has limited space to sit .…
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",comments,3,"1. The windows are not absolutely sound-proof. I was staying in 806 (17-23OCT) and was not comfortable with traffic noise outside.Our colleague from Denmark (Torben Hyldeqvist) was staying on same side (306) was very unhappy about the same. His room was never changed to higher floors or other side of the hotel, in spite of a direct request from him.  2. Two of the reception staff were absolutely unprofessional... we do understand that one needs to say 'No' at times, But the body language / words used were quite unethical & unprofessional. The security staff at the gate / main entrance of the hotel were not attentive & valueing presence of a foreigner with us. Either we or own own car driver was doing a duty of guard to promptly open the car doors upon arrival.  Just to keep you…"
Taj Club House,Fish smelt like fish,3,"I was transiting via Chennai in the middle of the night and needed to get some food (because Chennai airport is hopeless). That's how and why I ended up at Taj Club House at 4am. There was only one single guest in the whole ground floor of the hotel - me. It was a bit spooky. How old is this place anyway? I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest. I'm not sure what the story of the hotel is, but I think I need to return during the day to see if it's going to be a different scene.…"
Hilton Chennai,An intimidating building,3,Went for a conference only so there was not much that I could comment on  .   How strangely un-Hilton like  this was!! The first impression is that this is a large gloomy boxlike building with a dark lobby/ reception area.    The lobby staff is very nice however.  Most Asian need ablutions after using the loo for cultural and religious reasons . The Hilton  public toilets did not have a hand held shower. Strange indeed? is this the same in other hotels as well?   The food except the paneer and kheer was so so.   And their chocolate chip cookies are no better than the the usual commercial offerings.…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Dinner at Pan Asian,3,The meal started well with nicely presented and tasty dim sun and sushi rolls. The main rice and noodle based courses were more about big portions and less about presentation and taste.  Service was efficient without being particularly friendly. The wine list was priced excessively high with the equivalent Italian table wine from our previous night's dinner - China Xo at the Leela Palace - being double the price. This can only be profit margin. No wine for us then!  The quoted hotel taxi price was ten times the price of the taxi that brought us so we fired up the Uber App and 5 minutes later were in the normal world again. …
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not the best at that price point!,3,"Well, the hotel is situated right in the middle of the city. Some how, unlike my other Hyatt experiences, this was pretty average. There were many people as their reception staffs, yet they took more than 30 minutes to get my room, which was prepaid! They lacked attitude and training. And after reaching the room with the luggage, it was found that the key was not programmed - again go back to reception, wait, get it programmed and finally opened the door after a neat 30+ minutes. The room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was huge with a nice tub. The TV lacked choices of channels and bed was nice. I didn't try any of the foods, including breakfast and hence no comments. The check out was just ok, which took 10 minutes again! In one sentence, barring the front desk…"
GreenPark Chennai,A mixed-up review! ,3,"Have been to this place twice recently for wedding receptions. Once u get inside of the front gate, the space,ambience & food are all SUPERLATIVE.  What has to be mentioned is the trip to that front gate. Signage is very very bad! The board is not clearly visible from either side. Travelling 8-10kms for a reception, around 90% was covered in less than half-hour. The rest took another 45-50mnts! Traffic is just HORRENDOUS!!! No traffic signal or policemen to help.  Wish there will be some speedy solution to this! …"
The Park Chennai,Average hotel,3,Average hotel as compared to other 5 stars. The night club is happening. But again chennai now has so many other places to party at.  Very centrally located and not very far from the beach either. The pizzas are really good. The rooftop poolside area is nice. …
The Park Chennai,"great location, poor room management",3,"an excellent location gone waste. the tap of the washbasin was leaking profusely and it took them two attempts and many hours to fix up. Include few hours of discomfort in your two days of stay and there it goes !! On the positive side, the location is very central and breakfast spread was very good.An apt hotel for business traveler on a short trip. Rooftop pool was worth it. All in all, if the rooms can be taken better care of, it  can provide very good value for money.…"
Taj Club House,Restaurant review only - disappointed,3,"This review is only for the restaurant, not the hotel. Disappointed: That is the word that we came out with. Had gone for a business lunch and ordered the buffet. Previous day, called for table booking, no answer from the restaurant, so was transferred to Table Bookings. They took my details but could not answer my questions, promised to call me back. Never got the call back and neither was our booking sent to the restaurant. Landed the next day without reservation but were lucky to get table. Buffet is only for soups, salads and dessert, and you are allowed to order one main course from the menu. One veg and one non veg soup, about 5 veg and 5 non veg pre prepared salads. Additional salad counter with veg salad items for mix n match. No starters at all. Compared to other…"
Hilton Chennai,my first stay at Chennai Hilton,3,"The hotel appearance and security is good.  They made the children feel special.  But, there were many things that didn't work.  None of the power outlets worked except the one in the bathroom.  The bathroom flush didn't work.  Their instructions book in the room said that free wi-fi is available for guests on the floor I stayed in.  But, it didn't.  When I called the front desk, they just said that I need to pay.  So, overall, I was not very satisfied with the experience…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not upto Hyatt standards but convenient location and comfortable rooms,3,"I have  been in other Hyatt hotels in Delhi and Mumbai but this one doesn't meet the overall standards:  1. Room: We got an excellent room but it had some housekeeping issues like bath-tub drain was clogged. Despite calling the house-keeping staff twice, it remained like that until next morning with clogged water in it. 2. Other hotel services - Travel desk was excellent. Driver Satya was one of the best drivers I have met in terms of hospitality. They arranged for my US visa embassy transfers very efficiently. Pool was very nice and well-maintained. Lobby and reception services could have been better. As soon as a guest comes to check-in, they look for a reception. For some reasons, the lobby area was extremely crowded and looked like a railway station as there is not enough…"
The Park Chennai,"Nothing great, mediocore",3,"I stayed there for my Visa interview at chennai. The room given to me was very substandard, not at all a 5 star level. The room was at a corner and not well maintained. They have a store room or something next to the room so early morning there was lot of noise because of which my sleep was disrupted. Some staffs at counter was not helpful at all. They do not provide information about their complimentary services unless you ask them. The breakfast provided at their restaurant was just at par, could you be much better, same with the service there. They have a late checkout option which they hesitate to disclose to customers. Upon asking they say 2 pm but I could see some of their regular airline customers check out as late as 3:30pm. I would not visit them again given an option,…"
The Park Chennai,Unique experience,3,This is my first stay in this hotel. I hotel ambiance is not so great and I came to know that this is of bolly wood theme with few old movie posters here and there and in the hotel rooms as well. If the posters in the room is of any scenic then it might be good. I booked because it is very near to Us consulate.…
GreenPark Chennai,Almost a five star,3,"..yet a few things that bother you are  the stink from the water after you'v used the flush. the dated furniture in the room no complimentary airport transfer (the airport isn't very far) and the food; I was at the hotel for 5 days and trust me I  had no option but to eat the hotel food. tired all the restaurants but the food quality sadly stayed dismal. Out of all the departments it seemed F&B was highly overlooked. Biryani (mid night biryani) was a flop, the grill and buffet by the pool disappointing, buffet breakfast could have been better. it seemed someone in the kitchen was not totally into it.  Anyways.. The positive,  Staff, extremely polite and cooperative.  Cleanliness of highest standard. The calmness in the room and the floor was helpful. The hotel property is nice…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Nice hotel & Staff / Room toilets not Family Friendly,3,"I am visiting Chennei after 25 years from Singapore . Nice hotel and very helpful staff at bell counter . Assisted us with Taxi and Luggage. .  The housekeeping staff from kerala & Nagaland were very helpful . Room is nice but the bath & toilet if not family friendly if you have adult chn from 2 different gender, though the room toilets is great for couples . WC ventilation not good  The room is very dim during night time need more lighting if you searching for things or packing your luggage . During the day the lighting is good has they have a huge glass window .  Lift system to rooms is very inconvenient , as you have to change lifts to go to the rooms .

It has obviously been a grand hotel (as the name suggests) in days gone by but there are signs of wear & weariness in the rooms. Still very clean but aged.…
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Amazing Art! But declining hotel.,3,"I stayed at this hotel last year for a business trip and was really impressed. Upon returning a year later, the hotel has really started to dip. The rooms this year were stuff, smelly, dim lighting and stains on the chaise, the curtains and the countertops. There were a few dead bugs in the bathroom and the curtains were broken and would not close. There was NO hot water for 2 days. I was traveling with a group and none of us could get hot water. The breakfast buffet also went downhill. Last year it was one of my favorites in the 6 hotels I stayed at across India, this year it was toward the bottom. We had to ask for drinks multiple times. The plates and napkins were dirty and ordered food, like dosas and eggs, never arrived to the table. There were also mosquitos everywhere. I…"
The Park Chennai,"Almost booked this hotel, but backed off after seeing comments",3,"Hospitality industry runs on a fine line..Small things makes a big difference for customers..Good or even bad.. I wanted to book and infact almost booked a top-end Regency I think (not expensive in my world), but backed off after reading comments. Thanks a lot to the respected people who wrote their reviews spending their valuable time. I am usually a fan of ""The Park"" but not Chennai. I would like pass on - But hopefully it gets better after renovation.  Will catch on my next visit.…"
Hilton Chennai,Disappointing!,3,"I am silver member and currently staying at this property for 36 straight nights.  Even though I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival requesting a room upgrade or at least allow access to the executive lounge, I was denied.  Not just that, they had the audacity to ask me to pay for my upgrade.  I booked a room with a city view and had requested a room on high floor, and I got neither.  In the past other Hilton properties went out of their way to take care of me as I am a loyal Hilton member, but not this one.  My work will bring me to Chennai often and rest assured I will never stay at this property again.…"
The Park Chennai,1 night stay,3,"I had stayed overnight between a hectic business meeting. I found the hotel to be very slow. I found many things not upto the mark. I had sent in my luggage in the morning, but when I reached late in the night, exhausted, I had to wait for a long time to only give my photo id. There were inadequate staff manning the counters as the staff were decent and helpful. In the room itself, there was 1 cup for making tea and no spoon. The morning breakfast experience was the worst. It appeared that the ""Complimentary breakfast"" was treated as a compliment by the staff. I got a table and had to ask for cutlery, water, napkin. Items like vada was over even at 9.00 am and came in after a very long time. I ordered a cup of coffee and had to remind the staff many times over 20 minutes for the…"
The Park Chennai,Average ,3,"The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location, bang on Gemini flyover opposite the US embassy and on Nungambakkam Road. However the property is quite run down and the lack of maintenance and upkeep is seen all over the place. The marble floored toilets are stained, the upholstery damp and the fittings worn out. The doors squeak as they close and a sign of decadence is clearly visible. Stay here if you must. Ideal location if you are coming in for some work at the US embassy like I did. The breakfast is good. Lunch spread was average. …"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",stay at lemon tree,3,the hotel was good but the food was not the worth. it was really tasteless to say the least.

Taj Club House,,3,Being an Epicure Plus Gold Member - i am entitled for a free upgrade subject to availability.  I received a call from the hotel a day before for my check in time however at arrival at around 3:00pm next day i still had to wait for an hour for room to be available. Then i was informed i am being upgraded. Not happy with the room in spite of being upgraded. The room was exactly the same as i stayed last time (without the upgrade) so not clear what was upgrade all about.   Choice of TV channels is very poor. No HD channels and set-up box is very slow and outdated.  Not the experience expected from Taj Group.…

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Highs and lows...,3,"Location - Mount Road, Cant beat it.  Checkin - Effecient, Warm [with a room upgrade to boot]  Luggage - Someone forgot to send it up to our room. And it took multiple reminders for it to finally get to our room  Room - Pretty nice. Sore points - The shower stalls needed a good scrub. The joints had black stains from water, soap and other grime! Pretty gross for a Hyatt. I would say that housekeeping - maintenance of bathrooms is poor.  Restaurant - We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was nice. But, the service was disappointing. We never got several of orders from the live counters. They were just overwhelmed with a half full restaurant.  Valet - Attentive and helpful. But, there could be a delay of 15+ minutes to fetch your car. I would recommend self parking if you are…"

GreenPark Chennai,Yea but!!,3,A regular visitor from January to May this year both pre and post elections. I mentioned that because of the differences in experiences.  Pre election I felt a warm attentive feel around the hotel the bar food and restaurant were superb and well presented  During the election there were clearly more important persons staying and the focus completely left the regular CustomerCare very much a bowing and scraping approach to these attendees and no one else really mattered  During the campaigns the bars were closed or dry during election same thing. So really very little quality during that month   The breakfast and pool area was well provided for and maintained all through with good snacks available   I also remember taxi access was slow and security unnecessarily complex and…
Hilton Chennai,Ayla Restaurant in Hilton Chennai,3,"Myself, my wife and son had visited your Vasco Restaurant,at Hilton,Chennai this evening(07-May-2011) for dinner. We all enjoyed the food and services.   However, after the dinner when we requested for mouth freshners, we were informed that it is available only in Room Services. I was shocked by this reply. In fact we regularly go for dinners and also as room guests at ITC group, Taj etc and we always use to get mouth freshners at their Restaurants. In room services, we get all dental kit, shaving kit etc. But the first time in your Hotel that mouth freshners are available in Room services and not in restaurant.  I think if   Hotel is only to cater to foreigners and not for Indians, they may very well remove all the Indian dishes from their  menu also mention Indians are not…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,OK,3,"Spent one night at this hotel. The room i stayed at was ok but probably needs some updating, its starting to feel a bit old. Great lobby though & nice choice of restaurants. The service at the Spice Haat for dinner wasn't really great - had to ask 3 different people to get a drinks menu. Staff that check you in were just superb though. So an inconsistent experience.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Just okay,3,"I booked a meeting here, rooms for the attendees, and stayed for 4 nights myself. The reservation system needs work: they tried to check me out 3 days early, I had to confirm FOUR times the people I had booked for 2 nights...staff friendly and helpful, but you can tell something is not working.  The rooms are just okay: no desk lighting, weird bathroom doors (okay if alone, awkward if not!!), dryer requires thumb hold (if you've got hair to dry you'll understand!), no black out window screens, coffee is nescafe powder but there are liquid creamers, standard wifi was good (no need to upgrade). It was clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable. Hate the closet in the bathroom with no door though - easy to get stuff on your clothes and I prefer privacy. It was also very hot on the…"
The Park Chennai,Not the Best,3,"Having stayed at this hotel  in 2013, we found a big change.  The service was not upto standard and staff were not friendly and helpful. At that time, we rated this the best hotel in Chennai, not anymore.  . Even the breakfast was not as good two years ago, in fact the food they served was not upto a five star hotel, .  Our friends stay at another hotel before we arrived and joined us here and they were very disappointed with this place.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Great hardware, poor software ",3,"The building is huge. The staircase at the lobby is magnificent. Rooms are nice with iPad controls. Be careful in the corridors - a staff pushing a service cart almost dashed into me.   But the service is poor. Staff not the best trained. Mistakes happen at check in. I received keys to another guest's room by mistake. Air conditioning often gives trouble. Mattresses are not the most comfortable.   What redeems this hotel is exceptional cuisine. Breakfast is mouth watering. South Indian dishes are very, very authentic. Visit Peshawari or the Asian cuisine restaurant.   This should be a 5 rating hotel. …"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Expensive Hotel with Average services,3,"I went to this hotel with positive expectations being the brand but at the end it was a quite an average experience . The location of the hotel is really good and important areas are within approach. The staff of the hotel is non cooperative and i found them little rude, not ready for any kind of help or adjustments. The restaurant facilities are average but the prizing of the basic things like water, tea etc. are extremely expensive beyond any justification.  The in room dining has very little options and buffet breakfast timing does not suite the early flight catchers . Hotel do not provide them with any other option. I hope to see and user friendly services if i stay in future.…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Fair for business trips but should do better,3,"On a business trip, I did not choose the hotel. Lemon Tree (be careful there is another old one,  same name) is near office and not far from airport, which is very important considering heavy traffic in Chennai. First disappointment: our office had not been told wifi was not included in the price. The wifi package includes 2 pieces of laundry, but costs around 15€ per day, which is really costly for this class of hotel. The room size is OK, but the cleanliness is not perfect: I don't know if this is due to the recent opening but dust could be found everywhere, on the dark floor as well as on hangers in the cupboard. I wanted to have a shower upon arrival after a 23 hours journey, but the soap dispenser did not work. I called and had to wait for someone to fix it. After that I…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Third and last stay,3,"Stayed here on business for the third and last time. Yes, it is gorgeous and huge. Yes, the rooms are well-appointed and you operate lights, TV, etc. with an in-room iPad. Yes, there are many restaurants to choose from.  But:  The rooms are so fussy with fixtures and doors and mirrors and furniture that I'm always bumping in to something.   You can't walk from the hotel to check out the local street scene. First you have to get out of the huge walled compound. Then it's on a busy street that is not friendly for pedestrians (even by Chennai standards).  It's so big that you get lost in the crowd. And there's always a crowd.  The over-the-top attitude is tiring. There's always a staff person in front of you. There are more toiletries in the room and added every day than anyone can…"

GreenPark Chennai,Misleading 5*,3,"We booked this hotel after being recommended by our friends who had recently stayed for a wedding.   The hotel itself is located opposite a mall, very convenient if your trip involves shopping, eating nice food and there are places in the mall to entertain kids.   Room: The room is very much out dated and in need of an up-lift. I knew this already through the pictures on trip advisor, however I was under the impression that it would be very clean still.  On the day of arrival, they were exceptionally good in providing us with a room earlier than the usual check in time. As I removed the duvet from the bed to put my very tired kids to bed after a 24 hour journey to India, I noticed so many small hair on the bed. It was digusting! And started to wonder what else they Jang changed…"

GreenPark Chennai,Manager needs to wake up and engage with hotel guests,3,"I had previously given a very good score for this hotel, but this time round, I was disappointed. When I am writing ‘not so good’ reviews, I always start with the positive aspects of our stay: 1.	The service at restaurant was exceptional; staff were very well trained, and the food was so delicious. The restaurant manager, Mr Senthil Kumar was always on the ground, and I think this made all the difference.. 2.	The concierge/ bell boys were also very helpful and go out of the way to assist us. The best part is, we had the feeling that their service was sincere and rendered without much expectations... We travelled as a big group (7 adults in 3 rooms), and had several unpleasant encounters and I will fault the hotel management for this : 1.	Upon checking in, we were given free…"
The Park Chennai,Six O One is just another one,3,"I was looking for a riveting ambiance, some quiet and of course great food for my dinner with my son yesterday night. I thought The Park's restaurants will provide me all these as I was guided to its 24 hr restaurant Six O One.   The initial experience was very good as the polite lady at the entrance ushered us in and we chose what we thought was a amiable seat. The spread looked good with local, Indian, Chinese and international selections, a tempting corner full of desserts and a wide selection of salads. Near the buffet counter were lit a few terracotta ovens to cater to the demands for local dishes like Pongal and others. These fire places added character to the setting.  The sea food broth made a good beginning, but starters played truant as we had to wait for an age to be…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Big and bland,3,"I'm an SPG Platinum member, who used to stay at the old ITC Chola - due to its proximity to the centre of Chennai, and then at the ITC Park Sheraton.  I have been looking forward to returning to Chennai and staying at the ITC Grand Chola for a long time.  The photos looked huge and grand and imposing, and I anticipated it being something very special. Unfortunately, when I did stay I found it huge, and grand, but ultimately underwhelming.  Perhaps it is possible to make something too large, and too marble, too vast, but take away that special quality that gives the hotel life and soul and interest.  Make no mistake, this is a huge hotel.  Apparently the third largest in India. It has an entrance on every side - which they make sure you are aware of by unneccessarily making taxis…"
Hilton Chennai,New hotel with all Euro mod cons and a good location,3,"Very helpful staff from the airport to the room make the initial experience a good one. The hotel is new and so is still relatively quiet, not for long as it is far better than some of the other chain hotels in the region. The rooms are well appointed and modern with all the usual features and services you need as a business traveller. The gym is fairly basic with a couple of running machines and bikes, not top spec but good enough to allow you to train. The roof top pool looks great but is so close to the bar that I doubt many will use it as quite public. The roof top bar is very well designed and laid out although the service was patchy. The 3rd floor bar and restaurants are very good, wide choice and friendly service. The air con was an issue in my 9th floor room as it really…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Decent value for money,3,"I stayed for a night while en route to elsewhere on 17.03.2014. The airport pick-up and drop-in services were on-time and comfortable. Check-in and check-out were efficiently handled. The room service was prompt and to the point.   However, the service in the brunch buffet at Garden Cafe was the poorest I've experienced when comparable to restaurants of equal repute, being staffed with quite young chaps who looked and sounded clueless. The ambience was ruined by a bunch of ""newly-employed-in-IT-and-not-so-well-behaved"" clientele who seemd to have fasted for days just for this occassion and not have regards for other clients. Well, I'm no one to judge them, but my suggestion is to increase the prices two-fold.  The dinner at the 24 hour restaurant/cafe near the lobby was a…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Deepak Shah,3,"Booking was easy & check-in was smooth.  Courteous & friendly staff but hotel rooms are old....  old deco style...not with today's modern touch.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Poor customer relations,3,"This feedback is following today's incident over booking a table at 'Peshawari' at the ITC grand chola, Chennai.  On calling the desk for the reservation to be made, I was informed that I would get a call back in a few minutes to after checking to confirm, after 45 minutes and after NO call from the hotel, I call back only to hear the staff from the other end telling me that the staff in question IS IN A MEETING!  Now, this is certainly not the response anyone would expect from a 5/7 star rated hotel, not to mention from the ITC group!  This is the second time this has happened in the span of 1 week! The sheer experience of dining at the ITC brand is ruined!  If this is the training the staff attending the phones have received, one can only imagine how horrible the other…"
Hilton Chennai,New hotel with all Euro mod cons and a good location,3,"Very helpful staff from the airport to the room make the initial experience a good one. The hotel is new and so is still relatively quiet, not for long as it is far better than some of the other chain hotels in the region. The rooms are well appointed and modern with all the usual features and services you need as a business traveller. The gym is fairly basic with a couple of running machines and bikes, not top spec but good enough to allow you to train. The roof top pool looks great but is so close to the bar that I doubt many will use it as quite public. The roof top bar is very well designed and laid out although the service was patchy. The 3rd floor bar and restaurants are very good, wide choice and friendly service. The air con was an issue in my 9th floor room as it really…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not the best at that price point!,3,"Well, the hotel is situated right in the middle of the city. Some how, unlike my other Hyatt experiences, this was pretty average. There were many people as their reception staffs, yet they took more than 30 minutes to get my room, which was prepaid! They lacked attitude and training. And after reaching the room with the luggage, it was found that the key was not programmed - again go back to reception, wait, get it programmed and finally opened the door after a neat 30+ minutes. The room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was huge with a nice tub. The TV lacked choices of channels and bed was nice. I didn't try any of the foods, including breakfast and hence no comments. The check out was just ok, which took 10 minutes again! In one sentence, barring the front desk…"
Hilton Chennai,Disappointing!,3,"I am silver member and currently staying at this property for 36 straight nights.  Even though I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival requesting a room upgrade or at least allow access to the executive lounge, I was denied.  Not just that, they had the audacity to ask me to pay for my upgrade.  I booked a room with a city view and had requested a room on high floor, and I got neither.  In the past other Hilton properties went out of their way to take care of me as I am a loyal Hilton member, but not this one.  My work will bring me to Chennai often and rest assured I will never stay at this property again.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Hotel struggling to keep up with service,3,"Let me first say that I am not familiar with ITC hotels and their service, but I've stayed at the Oberoi group of hotels and know that India is perfectly capable of providing world-class luxury/business hotels. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The hotel is in south Chennai, a short drive from the airport, but not convenient if your work is in central Chennai. There is a lot of traffic and construction work on the road to the city centre.  The exterior of the hotel is very grand, the building is massive, the architecture makes it looks like an ancient palace. Things get a bit confusing as you drive into the hotel grounds as you have to drive all the way around the building, past 3 entrances on each side to the entrance on the 4th side of the hotel.  The lobby also is very…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",comments,3,"1. The windows are not absolutely sound-proof. I was staying in 806 (17-23OCT) and was not comfortable with traffic noise outside.Our colleague from Denmark (Torben Hyldeqvist) was staying on same side (306) was very unhappy about the same. His room was never changed to higher floors or other side of the hotel, in spite of a direct request from him.  2. Two of the reception staff were absolutely unprofessional... we do understand that one needs to say 'No' at times, But the body language / words used were quite unethical & unprofessional. The security staff at the gate / main entrance of the hotel were not attentive & valueing presence of a foreigner with us. Either we or own own car driver was doing a duty of guard to promptly open the car doors upon arrival.  Just to keep you…"

The hotels are maintained very well and offer well appointed rooms for staying. The general hygeine is great  and the staff is extremely courteous and responsive. The breakfast buffet  offers a good spread of items and also great taste. The meal quality is also fine. The only suggestion would be to drop the room rentals a little bit considering that the delhi property traded at 6100 for a double occupancy , while chennai not a premier one traded at 6700 for a tripple occupancy. Rest all great. Sundar Narayan…"
The Park Chennai,Friendly and helpful but a bit run down,3,"We stayed in The Park for a weekend in Chennai to get over jet lag on the way to Kerala.  We had a special deal that gave us breakfast and free internet access.  However, for a nominally four-star hotel the rooms were relatively small and and a bit run down.  We did find a cockroach running around on the desk.  Although that is probably hard to avoid completely in a tropical climate, one would hope that this could be avoided in a four-star hotel.    The lobby is nice and spacious and the staff try to do their best to help but are not always very efficient.    The breakfast is buffet style and the selection is reasonable and, like many hotels in India, prepare an omelet to taste.  However, this was one of the best omelets that we had.  The tea and coffee come milky and…"
The Park Chennai,Bad experience related to service at Park,3,My wife loves the Tiramisu dessert served at 601 cafe in The Park Chennai. We used to make it a point to visit at least once a month for this dessert. But for the last 3 visits we have been highly dissappointed with the service in general. Whenever we went this particular dessert was not available. Once we had gone with a group of friends as we had highly recommended this dessert but to our embarrassment it was not available. A hotel of this calibur should atleast ensure that they have sufficient quantities of dessert to last atleast for the day. I would now be thinking twice before I go to The Park or probably find a new place for our late night desserts.…

More seriously ,the room was being paid for by us through the travel agent who had given us a voucher, which explicitly covered the third bed.

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Pleasant smelling hotel next to very busy road,3,"My company booked me into this hotel for an overnight stay as it was the nearest reasonably priced hotel to the airport. Facilities are limited, but it's fine for a short stay. The bar did not serve food so I had a steak sandwich in the restaurant. The restaurant staff offer a highly interactive level of service with advise on what to eat, drink and Chennai night life. I ended up drinking four sweet line soda's as the staff make the best I have tasted so far in India. My room was on the 2nd floor was very inviting despite being on the road side. The air conditioning is simple but effective and sound proofing was able to block out the 90% of road traffic noise.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Mixed Opinion,3,"With a view to accommodate my newly wed daughter and son-in-law in a top-class centrally located hotel, I had booked them from 18th Nov, 2016 evening to 23rd Nov, 2016 morning.  While the hotel staff strived to provide hospitality and convenience, the ambience is a bit impersonal. The floor boy who conducted us to the room did not bother to explain the conveniences and facilities within the room leaving us to explore and discover.  Within minutes of checking into the room, we were received by cockroaches about which we intimated to the house keeping. No one responded. When the guests experienced it again the second day, they had to forcefully lodge a complaint followed by pest control spraying in the presence of the guests.  On the day prior to checking out, my daughter (who was…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Jan 2013 visit,3,"Visited for an overnight stay, came across an unhelpful front desk staff member - after a bit of nudging, sorted out some reservation mix up and manager apologised later when he got to know. Indian hotel staff still have a long way to go. Rooms have some classic furniture but the cleanliness needs to go up a bit and the carpets on the corridor look tired.   Went to the spa, the hostess was lovely and the treatment option we had involved a 90 min massage. The girls were Mizo but spoke reasonable english. The massage was a bit of a cross between thai and ayurvedic approach. The girls were professional but relatively inexperienced.You know the masseur is good when your body says so. This wasn't.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Kinks to be worked out,3,"This hotel is new, with kinks to be worked out.  The staff--particularly at the concierge desk-- is professional, earnest and attentive; they really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and taken care of.  But the hotel has physical problems; in our case, the room key became inoperative several times a day, there was no hot water, and the shower didn't drain.  In each of these cases, the hotel promptly sent a repair person, and the fix lasted for an hour or so, before recurring.  We stayed here for four nights, and these problems never went away.  There are three restaurants.  The Indian restaurant has a wide ranging buffet, which was quite good.  The Italian restaurant was excellent (and a welcome break from consecutive days--three meals a day--of Indian buffets!). …"
The Park Chennai,A rather disappointing experience.,3,"We decided to stay here owing to the comfort of access to the embassy and other places in and around the city. This was our second time at the park and we were disappointed with the service of the reception staff as they took a long long time during the check-in and check-out process. The room was okay but the restrooms need an immediate make-over. They look overused and the leakage in the pipe under the sink was not fixed prior to the assigning of the room. The toiletries were inadequate for two of us. Overall, a rather disappointing experience for the amount of money spent.…"
The Park Chennai,Just average,3,"First of all it looks like its 3* hotel, interior design is poor and it is not maintained properly. At the entrance there is nobody to open the heavy door for you, so if you have heavy bags you have to do it all by yourself. When you enter reception loby there is some strange smell, its just not fresh... I was wondering how staff can stand there all day... Room furniture seems old and not cleaned properly. Bathroom also not so clean... and there is rust everywhere. It just seems like very old and never replaced. View from the window is scary, there is old abandoned building and also curtains can't open so you dont have to look at it. Breakfast is ok, room service food also, staff good but seems not so motivated... Overall this hotel needs big changes, refurbishing... Hope they…"

Safety: The hotel tries to maintain safety standards - rooms are sanitized and clean, and so are the public areas.. but the rules followed by other five star hotels are much stricter..  for example: Here, At the entrance, your luggage is neither checked nor sanitized, The entrance doors by themselves are not Covid safety friendly - since hundreds of hands push them on a daily basis- not sure how often the entrance handles are sanitized, the  step on sanitizer dispensers at a couple of places werent working properly, masks did not seem to be mandatory for guests…"

The Park Chennai,Leaves a bit to be desired,3,"Cesar Ritz said that the location is the most important thing for a hotel...by that count, The Park, Chennai has its location bang on. The hotel is located on Mount Road/Anna Salai in central Chennai and is close to everything. But the hotel itself is a mixed bag. The decor in the public areas is quite chic, though raucous weekend crowds spilling out from the Leather Bar into the ground floor guest lounge is irritating, to say the least. The rooms are acceptable-just. There is no storage space for baggage and clothes and of the couple of shelves in the closet, one is taken up by the safe. There is no provision to hang clothes-the shelf is not tall enough, unless it is a pair of shorts you want to hang up! The absence of adequate storage space in a hotel that is supposedly 5 star…"

The hallways are clean and well maintained, the rooms however could do with a little maintenance, especially in the bathroom.  The availability of hot water was a little variable. The fridge was well stocked and replenished daily. The Gym whilst small, was never busy in the morning during my stay, although could do with the aircon being turned on before it opens. I met the chef in the restaurant a couple of times, a pleasant gentleman offering suggestions and being generally helpful, unfortunately a little too attentive once the food had arrived, he seem to keep wanting gratification for his service.

The Park Chennai,Average ,3,"The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location, bang on Gemini flyover opposite the US embassy and on Nungambakkam Road. However the property is quite run down and the lack of maintenance and upkeep is seen all over the place. The marble floored toilets are stained, the upholstery damp and the fittings worn out. The doors squeak as they close and a sign of decadence is clearly visible. Stay here if you must. Ideal location if you are coming in for some work at the US embassy like I did. The breakfast is good. Lunch spread was average. …"
The Park Chennai,A Hotel desperately in need of modernization!,3,"This is one of the older star hotels in Chennai and has an enviable location - bang in the heart of the city, close to many offices, shopping areas, restaurants, consulates etc. However, the overall quality of the hotel has gone down over the years and it would be great if the management took cognizance of this and renovated/modernized the hotel.  Checkin was a bit slow. The room that i got had a door that did not close properly and the phone receiver had a musty smell. The room was also rather small and dark. Later, they moved me to another bigger room on a smoking floor. Thankfully, I did not get the smoke smell inside my room.  Room service was okay. Service at the BF buffet was downright sad.

Get dropped off at one which is the main lobby and of course its the wrong one. Btw the hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport and you can take an Uber here for around Rs 200.  Walked over to the towers lobby to get checked in. The hotel itself is actually gorgeous! Just very royal. Well put together and massive....easy to get lost in. Beautiful architecture. Check in is smooth and was upgraded to a Chola suite due to my Platinum status. Suite itself is just gorgeous. And massive! Like the wardrobe in the room is bigger than most rooms bathrooms massive.

I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest.

The not so good - a pub/bar at the ground floor that is noisy, gets noisier as the night progresses, if you wanted a quiet night after a tiring day or important day ahead, this will not help.  There was an anglo indian girl at the reception with a very poor attitude for customer service, she was doing some thing with a pile of papers and hardly could be bothered with customers waiting to be served, the rest of them did not do any better.

Yes, the rooms are well-appointed and you operate lights, TV, etc. with an in-room iPad. Yes, there are many restaurants to choose from.  But:  The rooms are so fussy with fixtures and doors and mirrors and furniture that I'm always bumping in to something.   You can't walk from the hotel to check out the local street scene. First you have to get out of the huge walled compound. Then it's on a busy street that is not friendly for pedestrians (even by Chennai standards).  It's so big that you get lost in the crowd. And there's always a crowd.  The over-the-top attitude is tiring. There's always a staff person in front of you. There are more toiletries in the room and added every day than anyone can…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Kinks to be worked out,3,"This hotel is new, with kinks to be worked out.  The staff--particularly at the concierge desk-- is professional, earnest and attentive; they really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and taken care of.  But the hotel has physical problems; in our case, the room key became inoperative several times a day, there was no hot water, and the shower didn't drain.  In each of these cases, the hotel promptly sent a repair person, and the fix lasted for an hour or so, before recurring.  We stayed here for four nights, and these problems never went away.  There are three restaurants.  The Indian restaurant has a wide ranging buffet, which was quite good.  The Italian restaurant was excellent (and a welcome break from consecutive days--three meals a day--of Indian buffets!). …"
The Park Chennai,Stones throw from US Consulate ,3,Two days stay was quite enjoyable. But my initial experience was poor. Check in was smooth and the room was nice. But I had reached 10PM and was looking for some food hence ordered room service- the number was not reachable even though the service was available till 12 midnight. 4 tries later when I asked to speak with duty manager they called me back and served me. It was 12 midnight by the time I got to sleep. The AC was cooling beyond 23 degrees so didn't get much sleep. Next day I had 8AM appointment to which I went half asleep.   But the experience after that was good. Very courteous staff. They were more than helpful.   Morning breakfast was very good spread. I didn't but you have to try their special tea.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Poor customer relations,3,"This feedback is following today's incident over booking a table at 'Peshawari' at the ITC grand chola, Chennai.  On calling the desk for the reservation to be made, I was informed that I would get a call back in a few minutes to after checking to confirm, after 45 minutes and after NO call from the hotel, I call back only to hear the staff from the other end telling me that the staff in question IS IN A MEETING!  Now, this is certainly not the response anyone would expect from a 5/7 star rated hotel, not to mention from the ITC group!  This is the second time this has happened in the span of 1 week! The sheer experience of dining at the ITC brand is ruined!  If this is the training the staff attending the phones have received, one can only imagine how horrible the other…"
Taj Club House,Fish smelt like fish,3,"I was transiting via Chennai in the middle of the night and needed to get some food (because Chennai airport is hopeless). That's how and why I ended up at Taj Club House at 4am. There was only one single guest in the whole ground floor of the hotel - me. It was a bit spooky. How old is this place anyway? I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest. I'm not sure what the story of the hotel is, but I think I need to return during the day to see if it's going to be a different scene.…"

GreenPark Chennai,Misleading 5*,3,"We booked this hotel after being recommended by our friends who had recently stayed for a wedding.   The hotel itself is located opposite a mall, very convenient if your trip involves shopping, eating nice food and there are places in the mall to entertain kids.   Room: The room is very much out dated and in need of an up-lift. I knew this already through the pictures on trip advisor, however I was under the impression that it would be very clean still.  On the day of arrival, they were exceptionally good in providing us with a room earlier than the usual check in time. As I removed the duvet from the bed to put my very tired kids to bed after a 24 hour journey to India, I noticed so many small hair on the bed. It was digusting! And started to wonder what else they Jang changed…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Wannabe Five Star Property!,3,They try very hard but this is not a five star property. At the most 4 stars. I would not stay here again. The check-in was smooth. The lobby is very unimpressive. The room is very averagely furnished. The bathroom area very badly designed. to get into the bath tub you need to go over a 16 inch thick wall. someone not very agile will injure himself or herself doing this. I was shocked to see a Squeezee Shower Gel and Shampoo Dispenser fitted on the wall a la Ibis! But Ibis has world class toiletries. This shower gel and shampoo reeked of coconut oil! Very pathetic toiletries for a Radisson in the garb of being eco friendly. The shower equipment was tough and jammed and leaking constantly. Very poor shower pressure. The air-conditioning was another horror story. The room…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","EXCELLENT INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICE TO IMPROVE !",3,"This is a 3-month new Flagship Luxury property in Chennai of the ITC Hotel Chain, located close to the Airport. Large acreage, large palatial structure with large interiors & massive columns - all signifying the ambitious Chola kingdom that built the huge 'BIg' Temple centuries ago in this State. 3 large pools, Gym, Spa etc. are lavish.  While the massive size, both external & internal, are impressive, the relatively lower height of the two wings of the main lobby & the predominant brown decor tend to be somewhat intimidating & claustrophobic. The Elevators are silent & quick, but have both manual & electronic key-card operation, & the latter was not working in some.

The rooms are great especially the ITC one or towers category,  A lot of options for the restaurants, a good gym. It’s a great feeling to stay here but the service is pathetic.......  Have stayed here at least 2 times in last 1 month and the biggest disappointment is that with each successive visit, the service and quality has gone down, But that’s been the trend with ITC , they somehow manage to get the service down for the in house guests....

GreenPark Chennai,Almost a five star,3,"..yet a few things that bother you are  the stink from the water after you'v used the flush. the dated furniture in the room no complimentary airport transfer (the airport isn't very far) and the food; I was at the hotel for 5 days and trust me I  had no option but to eat the hotel food. tired all the restaurants but the food quality sadly stayed dismal. Out of all the departments it seemed F&B was highly overlooked. Biryani (mid night biryani) was a flop, the grill and buffet by the pool disappointing, buffet breakfast could have been better. it seemed someone in the kitchen was not totally into it.  Anyways..

Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The hotel is in south Chennai, a short drive from the airport, but not convenient if your work is in central Chennai. There is a lot of traffic and construction work on the road to the city centre.  The exterior of the hotel is very grand, the building is massive, the architecture makes it looks like an ancient palace.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,"If this is the #2 hotel, Chennai is in trouble",3,"Summary: if you are a frequent traveller and used to a high standard of quality, do not stay here. If you are an infrequent traveller that is not too picky, this place should be fine for you.  Review: This can't possibly be the 2nd best hotel in Chennai and is definitely and not up to standards for Radisson Blu. If you've been to their locations in Europe, you'll be surprised this is allowed to be called a Radisson Blu.  On the good side, the beds are very comfortable, the staff is accomodating, and the lunch buffet was tasty.  On the not so good side, the rooms are musty, poorly cleaned over the years (my shower had mildew that looked like it had been there for years), and tired. I had 2 different rooms and both were of equally poor quality, so I don't think it was an anomoly.…"

For example in billing there is a serious problem. The coffee shop took so long to get the bill , despite repeated requests one noon time that we had to start walking out. More seriously ,the room was being paid for by us through the travel agent who had given us a voucher, which explicitly covered the third bed. Despite that more than half an hour was wasted at the time of check out because Reception insisted on charging us for the third bed , before it could be sorted out.

The Park Chennai,Friendly and helpful but a bit run down,3,"We stayed in The Park for a weekend in Chennai to get over jet lag on the way to Kerala.  We had a special deal that gave us breakfast and free internet access.  However, for a nominally four-star hotel the rooms were relatively small and and a bit run down.  We did find a cockroach running around on the desk.  Although that is probably hard to avoid completely in a tropical climate, one would hope that this could be avoided in a four-star hotel.    The lobby is nice and spacious and the staff try to do their best to help but are not always very efficient.    The breakfast is buffet style and the selection is reasonable and, like many hotels in India, prepare an omelet to taste.  However, this was one of the best omelets that we had.

The Park Chennai,Just average,3,"First of all it looks like its 3* hotel, interior design is poor and it is not maintained properly. At the entrance there is nobody to open the heavy door for you, so if you have heavy bags you have to do it all by yourself. When you enter reception loby there is some strange smell, its just not fresh... I was wondering how staff can stand there all day... Room furniture seems old and not cleaned properly. Bathroom also not so clean... and there is rust everywhere. It just seems like very old and never replaced. View from the window is scary, there is old abandoned building and also curtains can't open so you dont have to look at it. Breakfast is ok, room service food also, staff good but seems not so motivated... Overall this hotel needs big changes, refurbishing... Hope they…"
The Park Chennai,Good stay but service could have been better,3,"I stayed at THE PARK Chennai for two days. The rooms are nice and clean. Food is good and they do offer a variety to choose from. BUT, I was a bit disappointed at the service.  Firstly, water clogged up in wash basin. Not a good way to start with.  Secondly, the charger pins on one side of the bed was damaged. My phone charger would not plug in and when I plugged in my laptop charger, the entire room power was cut off..probably due to a short circuit. power was restored immediately though.  Then at the dining, I felt a bit ignored.  On first instance, I being alone choose to sit on a small table. After finishing off the starters, there wasn't any space left on the table to put a third plate. I got up and when came back, I was literally standing with main course in my hand and…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Pleasant Stay!,3,"We had booked two ITC one rooms. The first impression of the property is Wow. They have a different entrance and reception to the ITC one and tower rooms which is right near the entrance of the hotel - makes it convenient. The main lobby is rather far away from the main entrance - this is a humongous property. The check in was smooth.  The rooms were nice and facing the huge swimming pools. The bathroom was large. However, I need to mention that they are not as nice as the ITC one rooms at the ITC gardenia at Bangalore. This being a new hotel, they have Ipads to control everything from lighting, TV to opening the door in the room. The calls to room service, concierge, housekeeping are all routed through the 'welcome assistance' making it an irritating experience. Many times the…"

The joints had black stains from water, soap and other grime! Pretty gross for a Hyatt. I would say that housekeeping - maintenance of bathrooms is poor.  Restaurant - We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was nice. But, the service was disappointing. We never got several of orders from the live counters. They were just overwhelmed with a half full restaurant.  Valet - Attentive and helpful. But, there could be a delay of 15+ minutes to fetch your car. I would recommend self parking if you are…"

Nonetheless we were given both our rooms by around 11:15 and whilst we waited we were offered nice coffee which we were grateful for.   Some things which we disliked  Smell - from the time you enter the hotel and from everywhere in the hotel (not in the rooms) there is a lingering smell which isn’t pleasant. I think this is caused by the water feature they have on the ground floor and then on the first floor as well, but I may be wrong.   Lighting - The hotel lobby is poorly lit and feels empty.

When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the travel desk to book an excursion. They had a 10h excursion on offer at reasonable price. We, however, didn't have any interest in visiting a crocodile park etc. and asked for a price to just go for 1/2 day to see the temples. They were initially totally infexible but eventually agreed and at a lesser price. They insisted it takes 2 1/2 h one way, while we know it's about 1 1/2h drive, which it was.

While the hotel staff strived to provide hospitality and convenience, the ambience is a bit impersonal. The floor boy who conducted us to the room did not bother to explain the conveniences and facilities within the room leaving us to explore and discover.  Within minutes of checking into the room, we were received by cockroaches about which we intimated to the house keeping. No one responded. When the guests experienced it again the second day, they had to forcefully lodge a complaint followed by pest control spraying in the presence of the guests.  On the day prior to checking out, my daughter (who was…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nice hotel but pricey !,3,"This is a ""marbellous"" hotel and like one of the other reviewers said they have invested a lot in the building itself.

We stayed in the Towers Room. A day prior to check-in we had requested an extra bed and they had assured us that they would keep it ready. After checking in it took a couple of phone calls and in-person visits to the Towers Reception to get the bed.  Everything in the room is controlled via the iPad including the lighting and there are a few glitches there as the lights behind the TV keeping turning themselves on and off.

The house keeping guys start ringing the bell at about 845 in the morning asking if there is any laundry. 2.If you say no, they will then ask if they can clean the room. 3.If you tell them not now as one is getting ready to go for work, they will never turn and when you get back to the room in the evening, rooms are not cleaned. 4. when you point out, they respond as if why are you complaining.

Taj Club House,Average hotel. Taj experience lacking. ,3,"We stayed at Taj Club House for 3 nights recently. To begin with, the hotel did not have the feel of a Taj property. Even though it was Christmas time, the hotel looked dull. The rooms had hard beds and average interiors. We weren't that comfortable with such hard mattress so asked our room to be changed. This process took more than 24 hours and after that we were told that all rooms have the same mattress. Coming to the service, whenever we asked for anything( bath towel, bath robe, coffee mugs etc), the housekeeping staff always got the things in lesser quantities than asked for. For e.g.single.towel, single mug, single dental kit  etc. The hotel is conveniently located near many commercial and shopping areas like T Nagar. However on my next visit I would prefer similar…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Luxurious but service needs to step up,3,"Stayed in grand chola for 2 days last months. It is a super luxurious hotel with fantastic rooms and as a SPG platinum member, got upgraded to a massive suite which was opulent & royal to say the least. However, service levels leave a lot to be desired. 3 separate incidents which illustrate the same  1. Ordered a cheddar cheese sandwich & they gave us with a different cheese and tried to push it when my wife said it was a different one 2. Smoke alarm in a smoking room went off and had to wait for 30 minutes for someone to come and fix it 3.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","EXCELLENT INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICE TO IMPROVE !",3,"This is a 3-month new Flagship Luxury property in Chennai of the ITC Hotel Chain, located close to the Airport. Large acreage, large palatial structure with large interiors & massive columns - all signifying the ambitious Chola kingdom that built the huge 'BIg' Temple centuries ago in this State. 3 large pools, Gym, Spa etc. are lavish.  While the massive size, both external & internal, are impressive, the relatively lower height of the two wings of the main lobby & the predominant brown decor tend to be somewhat intimidating & claustrophobic. The Elevators are silent & quick, but have both manual & electronic key-card operation, & the latter was not working in some.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Average experience with some bright spots,3,"We had the most pathetic and Horrible check-in experience at ITC Grand Chola, and our sole reason to have had stayed at the hotel was Mr Amarnath (Duty Manager). It was because of his sole endeavour to address our grievance promptly and put in the corrective measures in place that we stayed at the property for 3 nights. Being a Taj Epicure member and have stayed at most premium hotels (Including ITC ones) in India and Abroad I can say that we never had worst experience at arrival anywhere else. The entire process of Luggage. Room allocation. staff courteousness at the welcome desk had been a nightmare. At arrival, there was no courteousness in the staff to offer a glass of water though there were quite many ladies standing and chatting. finally, after a wait of 20 mins, i asked…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Highs and lows...,3,"Location - Mount Road, Cant beat it.  Checkin - Effecient, Warm [with a room upgrade to boot]  Luggage - Someone forgot to send it up to our room. And it took multiple reminders for it to finally get to our room  Room - Pretty nice. Sore points - The shower stalls needed a good scrub. The joints had black stains from water, soap and other grime! Pretty gross for a Hyatt. I would say that housekeeping - maintenance of bathrooms is poor.  Restaurant - We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was nice. But, the service was disappointing. We never got several of orders from the live counters. They were just overwhelmed with a half full restaurant.  Valet - Attentive and helpful. But, there could be a delay of 15+ minutes to fetch your car. I would recommend self parking if you are…"

Most irritating is lots of trainees in all Dept. The guy supposed to escort me while checking in - couldn't find my room without my help. Even in BFAST -- lot of trainees who don't know what to do; HOW is the next Q.   They don't follow the simple rule- A LEARNER should always be accompanied with an instructor.  And there was mosquito in the room - informed to HK and Ms Sapna ( front office) too. But nothing happened.  If you call up IRD - it's ENGAGED most of the time for some reason.

GreenPark Chennai,I can’t accept that this is a 5 star property,3,"We booked two rooms for a short stay and requested for an interconnected room.   We arrived around 10am and as expected the rooms weren’t ready, we were fine with this as understood getting both the rooms ready for that time would be a challenge. Nonetheless we were given both our rooms by around 11:15 and whilst we waited we were offered nice coffee which we were grateful for.   Some things which we disliked  Smell - from the time you enter the hotel and from everywhere in the hotel (not in the rooms) there is a lingering smell which isn’t pleasant. I think this is caused by the water feature they have on the ground floor and then on the first floor as well, but I may be wrong.   Lighting - The hotel lobby is poorly lit and feels empty. We love big hotel lobbies which are well…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Every picture tells a story,3,We have just stayed at this hotel and it quite simply is not 5 star. We moved from the ITC Hotel where we were very happy but we had previously planned to move to the Hyatt due to the fact they advertised washer/dryer. After much travelling we needed to wash our clothes in a washing machine! It turned out the washer/dryer advertised was the sink in the bedroom and the hair dryer!!! During our needless stay we were constantly itchy with our skin being Irritated by dust. We asked for a deep clean for our bedroom but it didn't improve. You will see from the pics I was bitten extensively in my bed on the last night. Swimming pool was in poor repair as you can see! Plus points was the airport liaison manager and the staff at the front door and the beautiful lobby. I hate complaining…

Cleanliness of the room could be improved though - bedside tables and desk tops could do with a proper clean / wipe.   Bathroom is spacious and clean.  Has a handheld shower and a rain shower - good water pressure.  however sometimes  jumps from hot to cooler water and back every now and then.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Third and last stay,3,"Stayed here on business for the third and last time. Yes, it is gorgeous and huge. Yes, the rooms are well-appointed and you operate lights, TV, etc. with an in-room iPad. Yes, there are many restaurants to choose from.  But:  The rooms are so fussy with fixtures and doors and mirrors and furniture that I'm always bumping in to something.   You can't walk from the hotel to check out the local street scene. First you have to get out of the huge walled compound. Then it's on a busy street that is not friendly for pedestrians (even by Chennai standards).  It's so big that you get lost in the crowd. And there's always a crowd.  The over-the-top attitude is tiring. There's always a staff person in front of you. There are more toiletries in the room and added every day than anyone can…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Just above average,3,"I rate this hotel just above average. For a Hyatt property it can do better.   The location is good. For some strange reason only men are subjected to security checks while women can walk in without any checks.   Check in and check out was smooth and fast. The room was way below average. The toilet was not clean. The curtains are shabby and don’t work well. The hooks and railing need to be fixed. No welcome fruit basket.  The food and service is good even though a bit pricy for Chennai. The wine list is only imported wine and very expensive. It is cheaper to drink in London paying in pounds!  And finally, just unacceptable is the cost of airport transfer. More than 10 times the normal Uber cost for an Innova ride is not the best way to end your stay.  Doubt I will return…"

The Park Chennai,Bad experience related to service at Park,3,My wife loves the Tiramisu dessert served at 601 cafe in The Park Chennai. We used to make it a point to visit at least once a month for this dessert. But for the last 3 visits we have been highly dissappointed with the service in general. Whenever we went this particular dessert was not available. Once we had gone with a group of friends as we had highly recommended this dessert but to our embarrassment it was not available. A hotel of this calibur should atleast ensure that they have sufficient quantities of dessert to last atleast for the day. I would now be thinking twice before I go to The Park or probably find a new place for our late night desserts.…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Billing at Front Desk a mess,3,"ITC normally has a high standard of professionalism but this Hotel does not come up to that. For example in billing there is a serious problem. The coffee shop took so long to get the bill , despite repeated requests one noon time that we had to start walking out. More seriously ,the room was being paid for by us through the travel agent who had given us a voucher, which explicitly covered the third bed. Despite that more than half an hour was wasted at the time of check out because Reception insisted on charging us for the third bed , before it could be sorted out.  A large Hotel need not be confusing but this one with 600 rooms and 4 lobbies is, at the moment  The rooms are nice and the food is good…"
The Park Chennai,Good location,3,I stayed here for a night on Feb 8th 2012. As I had a late flight I reached the hotel quite late and was upgraded to a executive suite. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. The location of this hotel is great. I did find the paint from the walls peel off near the windows. The next day I was shifted to another room. The front desk called me a couple of times to know when I would be checking out from the executive suite. I found that to be annoying. The breakfast is good and the spread quite nice. They charge for the internet in the room which I think is not justified.  The room I was shifted to was a corner room and quite small.The bed was comfortable. Overall it was a decent experience but I expected more out of Park hotels.…

GreenPark Chennai,Good Hotel...poor service,3,"I stayed at Green Park last week for 3 days for a company conference.  While the hotel itself is good, the service seems bit sketchy. Since the company had booked the conference facilities at the hotel, we got a special rate for booking rooms at the hotel. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I'd been upgraded to Business Club Room.  However, this pleasant surprise was short-lived. I came to know that while the room was being upgraded, the benefits of the room weren't! It meant that I couldn't avail the facilities and benefits that came with that category of the room. I wonder what kind of ""upgrade"" was this!!!  When I inquired about this at the reception, the folks there were clueless...what more could I have expected!!! When I requested that I speak with the…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,OK But Not Number 2 - Average Hotel,3,"Stayed here on a recent trip to India.  The hotel is close to the airport but I would not consider this to be a number 2 hotel or a 5* property.  It was just average to above average in my books.  The room was very well stocked with everything you needed etc. but just not at the 5* level.  Price was certainly cheaper.  That said, but for having to be at the airport for a 6am flight to Kochi (and it was nice to be very very close), we would have stayed at the Taj Coromandel.  Also, was there just as the second monsoon started this past October.  I did notice there was a considerable issue with mosquitos (including in the hotel), perhaps an issue noticed in Chennai generally.  It was just average in my books and between 3-4* in terms of North Amercia standards.  Buffet was just…"

The Park Chennai,Avoidable Overpriced Hotel,3,"Very disappointing place. I believe the Hotel was built on an earlier Gemini Studio property. The corridors and rooms are lined with old movie posters. Unfortunately, it gives the entire place some very gloomy, seedy looks. Owners seem to have cut corners while designing the rooms. Toilets have just been squeezed into the rooms. Furniture looks cheap.  Ironically, I had stayed at the Hyatt the previous night and shifted here next night due to its proximity to my workplace. And the contrast could not have been starker.  I would recommend going for any other 5 stars in Chennai as this hotel is no comparison to the rest even though its pricing is nearly similar to Hyatt's. The only consolation was the Breakfast spread which was not too lavish but still ofacceptable quality.…"
Taj Club House,,3,Being an Epicure Plus Gold Member - i am entitled for a free upgrade subject to availability.  I received a call from the hotel a day before for my check in time however at arrival at around 3:00pm next day i still had to wait for an hour for room to be available. Then i was informed i am being upgraded. Not happy with the room in spite of being upgraded. The room was exactly the same as i stayed last time (without the upgrade) so not clear what was upgrade all about.   Choice of TV channels is very poor. No HD channels and set-up box is very slow and outdated.  Not the experience expected from Taj Group.…

The service at restaurant was exceptional; staff were very well trained, and the food was so delicious. The restaurant manager, Mr Senthil Kumar was always on the ground, and I think this made all the difference.. 2.	The concierge/ bell boys were also very helpful and go out of the way to assist us. The best part is, we had the feeling that their service was sincere and rendered without much expectations... We travelled as a big group (7 adults in 3 rooms), and had several unpleasant encounters and I will fault the hotel management for this : 1.	Upon checking in, we were given free…"

The Park Chennai,Leaves a bit to be desired,3,"Cesar Ritz said that the location is the most important thing for a hotel...by that count, The Park, Chennai has its location bang on. The hotel is located on Mount Road/Anna Salai in central Chennai and is close to everything. But the hotel itself is a mixed bag. The decor in the public areas is quite chic, though raucous weekend crowds spilling out from the Leather Bar into the ground floor guest lounge is irritating, to say the least. The rooms are acceptable-just. There is no storage space for baggage and clothes and of the couple of shelves in the closet, one is taken up by the safe. There is no provision to hang clothes-the shelf is not tall enough, unless it is a pair of shorts you want to hang up! The absence of adequate storage space in a hotel that is supposedly 5 star…"

The rooms are spacious and designed well, but that's where all good things come to an end. In my suite, I always found tiny insects flying around. The sofa in the seating room had a massive stain and when I requested for it to be changed, the seat was just reversed so the stain was not visible.

The wine list was priced excessively high with the equivalent Italian table wine from our previous night's dinner - China Xo at the Leela Palace - being double the price. This can only be profit margin. No wine for us then!

The not so good - a pub/bar at the ground floor that is noisy, gets noisier as the night progresses, if you wanted a quiet night after a tiring day or important day ahead, this will not help.  There was an anglo indian girl at the reception with a very poor attitude for customer service, she was doing some thing with a pile of papers and hardly could be bothered with customers waiting to be served, the rest of them did not do any better.

Most Asian need ablutions after using the loo for cultural and religious reasons . The Hilton  public toilets did not have a hand held shower.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent if you can tolerate the Mosquitos,3,Stayed there from 06 to 09 March 2013 . Impressive property indeed. The rooms were comfortable and the I pad guide was very handy. The motion sensors of the night lamp in my room No 2428 had malfunctioned the first Night in that it kept flickering even when I was motionless. Resultantly I could not sleep the first Night. I had to then figure out a way of disconnecting it. The next two nights were then dedicated to the Mosquitos. Slept well after I checked out.…
The Park Chennai,Rooms need renovation,3,"The 5 star tag doesn't apply to rooms - they have look of a 3 star property and need makeover badly. I don't why this is sold as a 5 star hotel. Gym facility, restaurant, bar are all pretty good but rooms are just bad. I suggest you stay someplace else till they get them fixed. Front desk service ain't of 5 star quality as well.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not a good first impression!,3,"I stayed at Hyatt Regency Chennai for 2 nights on a recent trip to India, and I was not at all impressed with the rooms. The hotel seems good, and the staff was ok. The hotel reception and centrally located main seating area is wonderfully designed, but I did not find the rooms on par with the rest of the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and designed well, but that's where all good things come to an end. In my suite, I always found tiny insects flying around. The sofa in the seating room had a massive stain and when I requested for it to be changed, the seat was just reversed so the stain was not visible. The restroom had water stagnation problem, and the stand-in shower door was missing all together. All of these problems were reported to the front-desk on day one, but they…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Responsible Luxury with an irresponsible service.,3,"The first thing about ITC Grand Chola is that it is massive and looks and feels luxurious. It’s huge and yes you feel really good once you enter this beautiful piece of architecture..... The rooms are great especially the ITC one or towers category,  A lot of options for the restaurants, a good gym. It’s a great feeling to stay here but the service is pathetic.......  Have stayed here at least 2 times in last 1 month and the biggest disappointment is that with each successive visit, the service and quality has gone down, But that’s been the trend with ITC , they somehow manage to get the service down for the in house guests.... Have been a loyal customer with ITC for last 6 years and often feel they have lost the customer focus they had earlier...  It’s a good experience to come…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Poor customer relations,3,"This feedback is following today's incident over booking a table at 'Peshawari' at the ITC grand chola, Chennai.  On calling the desk for the reservation to be made, I was informed that I would get a call back in a few minutes to after checking to confirm, after 45 minutes and after NO call from the hotel, I call back only to hear the staff from the other end telling me that the staff in question IS IN A MEETING!  Now, this is certainly not the response anyone would expect from a 5/7 star rated hotel, not to mention from the ITC group!  This is the second time this has happened in the span of 1 week! The sheer experience of dining at the ITC brand is ruined!  If this is the training the staff attending the phones have received, one can only imagine how horrible the other…"

The Park Chennai,Bad experience related to service at Park,3,My wife loves the Tiramisu dessert served at 601 cafe in The Park Chennai. We used to make it a point to visit at least once a month for this dessert. But for the last 3 visits we have been highly dissappointed with the service in general. Whenever we went this particular dessert was not available. Once we had gone with a group of friends as we had highly recommended this dessert but to our embarrassment it was not available. A hotel of this calibur should atleast ensure that they have sufficient quantities of dessert to last atleast for the day. I would now be thinking twice before I go to The Park or probably find a new place for our late night desserts.…
Taj Club House,Restaurant review only - disappointed,3,"This review is only for the restaurant, not the hotel. Disappointed: That is the word that we came out with. Had gone for a business lunch and ordered the buffet. Previous day, called for table booking, no answer from the restaurant, so was transferred to Table Bookings. They took my details but could not answer my questions, promised to call me back. Never got the call back and neither was our booking sent to the restaurant. Landed the next day without reservation but were lucky to get table. Buffet is only for soups, salads and dessert, and you are allowed to order one main course from the menu. One veg and one non veg soup, about 5 veg and 5 non veg pre prepared salads. Additional salad counter with veg salad items for mix n match. No starters at all. Compared to other…"

The Traffic to reach this hotel has made me so tired that next time I will never think of going to this hotel. Belive me it has taken 45 min travel from Satyam theater to this hotel at snail pace of traffic for a distance of 5km abd once your enter the hotel the only grand thing is the lobby level other then that nothing much to say, there are only two fresh rooms avaible at the both ends of the banquets which are very far away , one has to walk some hundreds of meters to reach.

The Park Chennai,"Relic, you might as well be in a shopping mall!",3,"We were there for a couple of days in Jan making a short visit to the city as the last stop after a 3 week long tour of India.   The Good - bang in the middle of the city, enough parking for your car, big ceilings when you enter, and ... that's about it.   The not so good - a pub/bar at the ground floor that is noisy, gets noisier as the night progresses, if you wanted a quiet night after a tiring day or important day ahead, this will not help.  There was an anglo indian girl at the reception with a very poor attitude for customer service, she was doing some thing with a pile of papers and hardly could be bothered with customers waiting to be served, the rest of them did not do any better. It was like visiting a municipality office! The entrance has tall doors, I mean really…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",comments,3,"1. The windows are not absolutely sound-proof. I was staying in 806 (17-23OCT) and was not comfortable with traffic noise outside.Our colleague from Denmark (Torben Hyldeqvist) was staying on same side (306) was very unhappy about the same. His room was never changed to higher floors or other side of the hotel, in spite of a direct request from him.  2. Two of the reception staff were absolutely unprofessional... we do understand that one needs to say 'No' at times, But the body language / words used were quite unethical & unprofessional. The security staff at the gate / main entrance of the hotel were not attentive & valueing presence of a foreigner with us. Either we or own own car driver was doing a duty of guard to promptly open the car doors upon arrival.  Just to keep you…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Mixed Opinion,3,"With a view to accommodate my newly wed daughter and son-in-law in a top-class centrally located hotel, I had booked them from 18th Nov, 2016 evening to 23rd Nov, 2016 morning.  While the hotel staff strived to provide hospitality and convenience, the ambience is a bit impersonal. The floor boy who conducted us to the room did not bother to explain the conveniences and facilities within the room leaving us to explore and discover.  Within minutes of checking into the room, we were received by cockroaches about which we intimated to the house keeping. No one responded. When the guests experienced it again the second day, they had to forcefully lodge a complaint followed by pest control spraying in the presence of the guests.  On the day prior to checking out, my daughter (who was…"

Taj Club House,Average hotel. Taj experience lacking. ,3,"We stayed at Taj Club House for 3 nights recently. To begin with, the hotel did not have the feel of a Taj property. Even though it was Christmas time, the hotel looked dull. The rooms had hard beds and average interiors. We weren't that comfortable with such hard mattress so asked our room to be changed. This process took more than 24 hours and after that we were told that all rooms have the same mattress. Coming to the service, whenever we asked for anything( bath towel, bath robe, coffee mugs etc), the housekeeping staff always got the things in lesser quantities than asked for. For e.g.single.towel, single mug, single dental kit  etc. The hotel is conveniently located near many commercial and shopping areas like T Nagar. However on my next visit I would prefer similar…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Good stay....not so nice ending,3,"Had a 1 night stay here. Hotel is a massive structure and has 4 different lobbies (which confuses the cab drivers) and frankly the guest as well since I didnt know which lobby I needed to go to. Get dropped off at one which is the main lobby and of course its the wrong one. Btw the hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport and you can take an Uber here for around Rs 200.  Walked over to the towers lobby to get checked in. The hotel itself is actually gorgeous! Just very royal. Well put together and massive....easy to get lost in. Beautiful architecture. Check in is smooth and was upgraded to a Chola suite due to my Platinum status. Suite itself is just gorgeous. And massive! Like the wardrobe in the room is bigger than most rooms bathrooms massive. Lotsa very nice features,…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Dinner at Pan Asian,3,The meal started well with nicely presented and tasty dim sun and sushi rolls. The main rice and noodle based courses were more about big portions and less about presentation and taste.  Service was efficient without being particularly friendly. The wine list was priced excessively high with the equivalent Italian table wine from our previous night's dinner - China Xo at the Leela Palace - being double the price. This can only be profit margin. No wine for us then!  The quoted hotel taxi price was ten times the price of the taxi that brought us so we fired up the Uber App and 5 minutes later were in the normal world again. …

The breakfast buffet  offers a good spread of items and also great taste. The meal quality is also fine.

GreenPark Chennai,Good base for Chennai,3,"3 is slightly harsh, this should be a 3.5.    Stayed for 2 days while in Chennai.  Hotel is about 30-40min by taxi from the airport due to traffic.  Overall good value.   The rooms are very spacious with comfortable (firm) King size bed and pillows.  Cleanliness of the room could be improved though - bedside tables and desk tops could do with a proper clean / wipe.   Bathroom is spacious and clean.  Has a handheld shower and a rain shower - good water pressure.  however sometimes  jumps from hot to cooler water and back every now and then.    Large desk and complementary WiFi in the room could suit business travellers.  Hotel also seems quite popular for weddings.   Service is friendly but due to some language barriers not always efficient (especially telephone requests from…"

GreenPark Chennai,Nice property,3,"Pretty nice property. Spacious rooms. Really clean and well maintained hotel. The food is pretty good at once upon a time. But their breakfast spread is a bit of a disappointment especially for the pricing.  It was overall a really pleasant stay. The only annoying element was at the time of check-in, they take a picture of their guests which I found unnecessary and despite telling the guy that we were uncomfortable with the action, the guy went ahead. It makes no sense why why would do that given that there are IDs already with our pictures, the logic was that people could claim they are staying in your room which was a very alarming thing to hear that is even possible to happen at a hotel of their scale. Given all the cameras on the floor, wouldn't it be easy to find out…"
GreenPark Chennai,Local hotel,3,"This is a typical Indian style hotel. The room is spacious and clean with light musky smell all the time.

I've never seen such a shower in any hotel! The staff in general are quite good and helpful except for the front desk staff by the name of Murugan who showed grouchiness when we inquired about room service bill.

The Park Chennai,Convenient location,3,My third stay in the hotel...over the years it looks a bit run judging by its external facade however just about manages to keep up with 5 star pretences on the inside.  Food and beverage seemed a bit on the pricier side judging by the room service menu listing.  I would rather step out of the hotel and eat at plenty of good stand alone restaurants in the walking vicinity...I would not only save a substantial amount of money for the organisation but would also shed some calories.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Luxurious but service needs to step up,3,"Stayed in grand chola for 2 days last months. It is a super luxurious hotel with fantastic rooms and as a SPG platinum member, got upgraded to a massive suite which was opulent & royal to say the least. However, service levels leave a lot to be desired. 3 separate incidents which illustrate the same  1. Ordered a cheddar cheese sandwich & they gave us with a different cheese and tried to push it when my wife said it was a different one 2. Smoke alarm in a smoking room went off and had to wait for 30 minutes for someone to come and fix it 3. Had to wait for 20 minutes to get the cheque in their coffee shop when there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant  For me, a 7 star hotel should have 7 star service and not just fancy rooms & massive halls.…"
Taj Club House,Fish smelt like fish,3,"I was transiting via Chennai in the middle of the night and needed to get some food (because Chennai airport is hopeless). That's how and why I ended up at Taj Club House at 4am. There was only one single guest in the whole ground floor of the hotel - me. It was a bit spooky. How old is this place anyway? I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest. I'm not sure what the story of the hotel is, but I think I need to return during the day to see if it's going to be a different scene.…"

The Park Chennai,Six O One is just another one,3,"I was looking for a riveting ambiance, some quiet and of course great food for my dinner with my son yesterday night. I thought The Park's restaurants will provide me all these as I was guided to its 24 hr restaurant Six O One.   The initial experience was very good as the polite lady at the entrance ushered us in and we chose what we thought was a amiable seat. The spread looked good with local, Indian, Chinese and international selections, a tempting corner full of desserts and a wide selection of salads. Near the buffet counter were lit a few terracotta ovens to cater to the demands for local dishes like Pongal and others. These fire places added character to the setting.  The sea food broth made a good beginning, but starters played truant as we had to wait for an age to be…"

That is however a lie. The room only had a shower.  To be fair, I did not complain about this fact since I was just not up for it, but during the rest of my stay it really annoyed me and I regret I didn't complain about it.  The breakfast buffe was medioker at best, good service but poor selection of food.  Did not visit the club lounge since I did not know where it was and did not bother to ask for it.  The air condition in my room was terribly loud so I had to shut it of during the nights to be able to sleep.

The house keeping guys start ringing the bell at about 845 in the morning asking if there is any laundry. 2.If you say no, they will then ask if they can clean the room. 3.If you tell them not now as one is getting ready to go for work, they will never turn and when you get back to the room in the evening, rooms are not cleaned. 4. when you point out, they respond as if why are you complaining.

I called up the restaurant reservation to inquire about the buffet options and possibility of a corporate discount. I didn't get a call for 15 minutes and I was told that we tried your number twice but no one picked. Indeed some problem with the phones.  The question is when a guest comes to stay for one night, he shouldn't be expected to get your housekeeping issues resolved.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nice hotel but pricey !,3,"This is a ""marbellous"" hotel and like one of the other reviewers said they have invested a lot in the building itself. One has to unnecessarily walk a lot through the marble corridors to reach one's room. To park the vehicle one has to take a ""parikrama"" around the hotel after seeing their four entrances!   We stayed in the Towers Room. A day prior to check-in we had requested an extra bed and they had assured us that they would keep it ready. After checking in it took a couple of phone calls and in-person visits to the Towers Reception to get the bed.  Everything in the room is controlled via the iPad including the lighting and there are a few glitches there as the lights behind the TV keeping turning themselves on and off.  The room rates are a bit expensive as the taxes add…"
The Park Chennai,Better to lower star rating to 3,3,"I have stayed in Room No : 1009 on 12th Nov.  1. As soon as i got down from the car, I really didn't know where to go. No one was there to greet us and to open those two big doors. We figured that out by looking at others. 2. There were lot of people waiting to Check in. At this time, no one was there to greet and to ask us to have welcome drink. 3. Water was leaking from bathroom glass to bedroom. Lot of inconvenience. We had to put lot of towels. No response, when i called '9' on phone. I had demonstrated this to duty manager at the time of checkout. He accepted it as a failure. 4. While we were down to have breakfast, no one is there to greet us and to show place to sit.  we had to wait for 10 min and asked on going waiter. 5. Just 10 min after we checked into the room, one…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Dinner at Pan Asian,3,The meal started well with nicely presented and tasty dim sun and sushi rolls. The main rice and noodle based courses were more about big portions and less about presentation and taste.  Service was efficient without being particularly friendly. The wine list was priced excessively high with the equivalent Italian table wine from our previous night's dinner - China Xo at the Leela Palace - being double the price. This can only be profit margin. No wine for us then!  The quoted hotel taxi price was ten times the price of the taxi that brought us so we fired up the Uber App and 5 minutes later were in the normal world again. …

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Highs and lows...,3,"Location - Mount Road, Cant beat it.  Checkin - Effecient, Warm [with a room upgrade to boot]  Luggage - Someone forgot to send it up to our room. And it took multiple reminders for it to finally get to our room  Room - Pretty nice. Sore points - The shower stalls needed a good scrub. The joints had black stains from water, soap and other grime! Pretty gross for a Hyatt. I would say that housekeeping - maintenance of bathrooms is poor.  Restaurant - We went for the Sunday brunch. Food was nice. But, the service was disappointing. We never got several of orders from the live counters. They were just overwhelmed with a half full restaurant.  Valet - Attentive and helpful. But, there could be a delay of 15+ minutes to fetch your car. I would recommend self parking if you are…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Every picture tells a story,3,We have just stayed at this hotel and it quite simply is not 5 star. We moved from the ITC Hotel where we were very happy but we had previously planned to move to the Hyatt due to the fact they advertised washer/dryer. After much travelling we needed to wash our clothes in a washing machine! It turned out the washer/dryer advertised was the sink in the bedroom and the hair dryer!!! During our needless stay we were constantly itchy with our skin being Irritated by dust. We asked for a deep clean for our bedroom but it didn't improve. You will see from the pics I was bitten extensively in my bed on the last night. Swimming pool was in poor repair as you can see! Plus points was the airport liaison manager and the staff at the front door and the beautiful lobby. I hate complaining…
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,"Good location, good service",3,"With a short taxi ride from the airport, The Radisson Blu offers a good central location to make a base from. The hallways are clean and well maintained, the rooms however could do with a little maintenance, especially in the bathroom.  The availability of hot water was a little variable. The fridge was well stocked and replenished daily. The Gym whilst small, was never busy in the morning during my stay, although could do with the aircon being turned on before it opens. I met the chef in the restaurant a couple of times, a pleasant gentleman offering suggestions and being generally helpful, unfortunately a little too attentive once the food had arrived, he seem to keep wanting gratification for his service. Don't bother with the kebab factory, the staff didn't listen to…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not a good first impression!,3,"I stayed at Hyatt Regency Chennai for 2 nights on a recent trip to India, and I was not at all impressed with the rooms. The hotel seems good, and the staff was ok. The hotel reception and centrally located main seating area is wonderfully designed, but I did not find the rooms on par with the rest of the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and designed well, but that's where all good things come to an end. In my suite, I always found tiny insects flying around. The sofa in the seating room had a massive stain and when I requested for it to be changed, the seat was just reversed so the stain was not visible. The restroom had water stagnation problem, and the stand-in shower door was missing all together. All of these problems were reported to the front-desk on day one, but they…"
Hilton Chennai,Disappointing!,3,"I am silver member and currently staying at this property for 36 straight nights.  Even though I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival requesting a room upgrade or at least allow access to the executive lounge, I was denied.  Not just that, they had the audacity to ask me to pay for my upgrade.  I booked a room with a city view and had requested a room on high floor, and I got neither.  In the past other Hilton properties went out of their way to take care of me as I am a loyal Hilton member, but not this one.  My work will bring me to Chennai often and rest assured I will never stay at this property again.…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not their usual level of service ,3,To begin with the check in was pretty slow. This was also due to some unruly guests who did not bring their ID proof with address and kept on barging in while the staff was doing my check in.

The Wifi was fast & ensures that I finish my work fast.   I went to the swimming pool in the evening around 815 pm. It’s an open air pool and one of the smallest pool I have seen. The temperature of the water was very comfortable.  But I could see that the picture water was not clean as there were dust sediments floating over the water. Also the pool was completely unattended. While I was…

The Park Chennai,Six O One is just another one,3,"I was looking for a riveting ambiance, some quiet and of course great food for my dinner with my son yesterday night. I thought The Park's restaurants will provide me all these as I was guided to its 24 hr restaurant Six O One.   The initial experience was very good as the polite lady at the entrance ushered us in and we chose what we thought was a amiable seat. The spread looked good with local, Indian, Chinese and international selections, a tempting corner full of desserts and a wide selection of salads. Near the buffet counter were lit a few terracotta ovens to cater to the demands for local dishes like Pongal and others. These fire places added character to the setting.  The sea food broth made a good beginning, but starters played truant as we had to wait for an age to be…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Third and last stay,3,"Stayed here on business for the third and last time. Yes, it is gorgeous and huge. Yes, the rooms are well-appointed and you operate lights, TV, etc. with an in-room iPad. Yes, there are many restaurants to choose from.  But:  The rooms are so fussy with fixtures and doors and mirrors and furniture that I'm always bumping in to something.   You can't walk from the hotel to check out the local street scene. First you have to get out of the huge walled compound. Then it's on a busy street that is not friendly for pedestrians (even by Chennai standards).  It's so big that you get lost in the crowd. And there's always a crowd.  The over-the-top attitude is tiring. There's always a staff person in front of you. There are more toiletries in the room and added every day than anyone can…"

What has to be mentioned is the trip to that front gate. Signage is very very bad! The board is not clearly visible from either side. Travelling 8-10kms for a reception, around 90% was covered in less than half-hour. The rest took another 45-50mnts! Traffic is just HORRENDOUS!!! No traffic signal or policemen to help.  Wish there will be some speedy solution to this! …"

Taj Club House,Fish smelt like fish,3,"I was transiting via Chennai in the middle of the night and needed to get some food (because Chennai airport is hopeless). That's how and why I ended up at Taj Club House at 4am. There was only one single guest in the whole ground floor of the hotel - me. It was a bit spooky. How old is this place anyway? I wanted to go local so I ordered a Madras Fish Curry and all they had to do was get that right. But for a one guest restaurant with one waiter, the fish was expectedly not the freshest. I'm not sure what the story of the hotel is, but I think I need to return during the day to see if it's going to be a different scene.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Hotel struggling to keep up with service,3,"Let me first say that I am not familiar with ITC hotels and their service, but I've stayed at the Oberoi group of hotels and know that India is perfectly capable of providing world-class luxury/business hotels. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The hotel is in south Chennai, a short drive from the airport, but not convenient if your work is in central Chennai. There is a lot of traffic and construction work on the road to the city centre.  The exterior of the hotel is very grand, the building is massive, the architecture makes it looks like an ancient palace. Things get a bit confusing as you drive into the hotel grounds as you have to drive all the way around the building, past 3 entrances on each side to the entrance on the 4th side of the hotel.  The lobby also is very…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,A Mixed Bag,3,"Stayed recently for couple of nights. Arrived late in the evening and as luck would have it, got the room farthest from the lift! The room is pretty standard, as you would expect it to be. The lights were very dim for some reason.  Anyway, after a good night’s sleep it was time for shower. For some reason I could not get the water temperature right for more than 10 seconds continuously. It is either too HOT or too COLD and somehow refuses to stay in between. I have noticed this issue at several hotels but somehow the Radisson’s have a knack of it especially in India.   Tried the free foot massage. It was nice and soothing. The bar is OK and the beer great! The food quality is great especially when the chef can accede to your little demands like replacing the chicken with fish in…"

The Park Chennai,Just average,3,"First of all it looks like its 3* hotel, interior design is poor and it is not maintained properly. At the entrance there is nobody to open the heavy door for you, so if you have heavy bags you have to do it all by yourself. When you enter reception loby there is some strange smell, its just not fresh... I was wondering how staff can stand there all day... Room furniture seems old and not cleaned properly. Bathroom also not so clean... and there is rust everywhere. It just seems like very old and never replaced. View from the window is scary, there is old abandoned building and also curtains can't open so you dont have to look at it. Breakfast is ok, room service food also, staff good but seems not so motivated... Overall this hotel needs big changes, refurbishing... Hope they…"

I received a call from the hotel a day before for my check in time however at arrival at around 3:00pm next day i still had to wait for an hour for room to be available. Then i was informed i am being upgraded. Not happy with the room in spite of being upgraded. The room was exactly the same as i stayed last time (without the upgrade) so not clear what was upgrade all about.   Choice of TV channels is very poor. No HD channels and set-up box is very slow and outdated.  Not the experience expected from Taj Group.…
Taj Club House,Average hotel. Taj experience lacking. ,3,"We stayed at Taj Club House for 3 nights recently. To begin with, the hotel did not have the feel of a Taj property. Even though it was Christmas time, the hotel looked dull. The rooms had hard beds and average interiors. We weren't that comfortable with such hard mattress so asked our room to be changed. This process took more than 24 hours and after that we were told that all rooms have the same mattress. Coming to the service, whenever we asked for anything( bath towel, bath robe, coffee mugs etc), the housekeeping staff always got the things in lesser quantities than asked for. For e.g.single.towel, single mug, single dental kit  etc. The hotel is conveniently located near many commercial and shopping areas like T Nagar. However on my next visit I would prefer similar…"

Wait staff at the upstairs bars are fantastic.  The lobby and grand staircase are amazing.  Peshwari is fantastic.  The not so good.  The front desk is understaffed and slow.  It took a while to check in.  I checked in around 6am, set the do not disturb signs and was awakened at 10, at 2, and at 4 with demands to clean the room.  Blatant disregard for signage.

His room was never changed to higher floors or other side of the hotel, in spite of a direct request from him.  2. Two of the reception staff were absolutely unprofessional... we do understand that one needs to say 'No' at times, But the body language / words used were quite unethical & unprofessional. The security staff at the gate / main entrance of the hotel were not attentive & valueing presence of a foreigner with us.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Not as promised,3,"Friendly and professional staff. Check in was quick and flawless.  Opted for a club room, which is said to have a ""Private spa tub"". That is however a lie. The room only had a shower.  To be fair, I did not complain about this fact since I was just not up for it, but during the rest of my stay it really annoyed me and I regret I didn't complain about it.  The breakfast buffe was medioker at best, good service but poor selection of food.  Did not visit the club lounge since I did not know where it was and did not bother to ask for it.  The air condition in my room was terribly loud so I had to shut it of during the nights to be able to sleep.   Location if good if you want to be near the airport, it takes about 1 hour to get to city center with taxi due to the traffic.  Pool area…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Kinks to be worked out,3,"This hotel is new, with kinks to be worked out.  The staff--particularly at the concierge desk-- is professional, earnest and attentive; they really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and taken care of.  But the hotel has physical problems; in our case, the room key became inoperative several times a day, there was no hot water, and the shower didn't drain.  In each of these cases, the hotel promptly sent a repair person, and the fix lasted for an hour or so, before recurring.  We stayed here for four nights, and these problems never went away.  There are three restaurants.  The Indian restaurant has a wide ranging buffet, which was quite good.  The Italian restaurant was excellent (and a welcome break from consecutive days--three meals a day--of Indian buffets!). …"

They are pretty standard, so dont leave a mark on the patron.. front desks can be a bit more efficient or there should be more people on the front desk, and the corridors and the carpets should be cleaner.   Service is very good though, but that is now expected of most hotels in this range too.  Bed was comfortable, the ac worked well and the room looked in ship shape. So from the inside, there was no problem. Room service was efficient and food tasted good. View - nothing to boast about. I had stayed in room 8302.  There are some good deals for patrons though. The buffet lunch @1100 is well worth its cost, and the restaurant seemed empty enough for you to enjoy it in peace. There were some…"

The hotel is new and so is still relatively quiet, not for long as it is far better than some of the other chain hotels in the region. The rooms are well appointed and modern with all the usual features and services you need as a business traveller. The gym is fairly basic with a couple of running machines and bikes, not top spec but good enough to allow you to train. The roof top pool looks great but is so close to the bar that I doubt many will use it as quite public. The roof top bar is very well designed and laid out although the service was patchy. The 3rd floor bar and restaurants are very good, wide choice and friendly service. The air con was an issue in my 9th floor room as it really…"
GreenPark Chennai,Yea but!!,3,A regular visitor from January to May this year both pre and post elections. I mentioned that because of the differences in experiences.  Pre election I felt a warm attentive feel around the hotel the bar food and restaurant were superb and well presented  During the election there were clearly more important persons staying and the focus completely left the regular CustomerCare very much a bowing and scraping approach to these attendees and no one else really mattered  During the campaigns the bars were closed or dry during election same thing. So really very little quality during that month   The breakfast and pool area was well provided for and maintained all through with good snacks available   I also remember taxi access was slow and security unnecessarily complex and…

The rooms are just okay: no desk lighting, weird bathroom doors (okay if alone, awkward if not!!), dryer requires thumb hold (if you've got hair to dry you'll understand!), no black out window screens, coffee is nescafe powder but there are liquid creamers, standard wifi was good (no need to upgrade). It was clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable. Hate the closet in the bathroom with no door though - easy to get stuff on your clothes and I prefer privacy. It was also very hot on the…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Rooms,3,"Rooms were well designed in looks, especially rest room. However, horrible tranquility of rooms. I could hear clearly if people are talking in next room or someone walking / talking in corridor or someone walking in room in next floor.  Free Internet was given for a sake. It get disconnected frequently so i had to use my mobile data for work.  Check-in experience was good, service in restaurant was good and food also was good. However they need to improve housekeeping in rooms. Bath towels was not changed 2nd day, some toiletries were missing and moreover i had to tell them twice in the gap of 2hrs to clean room.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Disappointing compared to earlier stays,3,"Stayed for 3 nights in Towers category room in second week of December.  The reservation experience is one of the worst I had ever experienced.It's a struggle to make reservation at this place. This is a recurring incident and surprisingly not resolved yet.  The place is huge and has been a benchmark in terms of service, food quality and grand ambience.  The breakfast buffet continues to be one of the best with wide variety of options however hospitality was disappointing compared to earlier set standards and experience.  The towers room size was very spacious with good wifi connectivity and iPad operated experience.  The residents lounge at ground floor was always full ...possibly due to imbalance in number of guests and size of lunge.Needs improvement.The other residents…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Great hotel - Very poor customer service!,3,The hotel itself is excellent but the staff needs to get their act together if they really want to keep up with the stature that this hotel represents!  I was traveling on business and had booked airport pickup and have a confirmation email from the hotel (email confirmation from Arish R) - this was done at least 2 week prior to my actual travel. No one showed up at the airport and I was later by the front desk that the pickup request was not attached to my reservation even though the email confirmed both the room and car reservations.  I contacted Nadeem Khan and Meghna Rao (Front Desk manager and Travel Manager) twice via email but did not get any response back from them!  The lack of a response/acknowledgement was what bothered me more than the screw up with the airport…

Out of all the departments it seemed F&B was highly overlooked. Biryani (mid night biryani) was a flop, the grill and buffet by the pool disappointing, buffet breakfast could have been better. it seemed someone in the kitchen was not totally into it.  Anyways..

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",This property doesn't really live up to expectations!!!,3,"This hotel is just 15 minutes away from the airport - a big advantage if you are in Chennai on a business trip. But my stay here was quite a let down. Expected better service given that this is a 3 star or 4 star property. On the first day, I had to wait almost 45 minutes for a table at the Citrus cafe. The dining area is quite small and there was a big group that had gathered at the cafe for dinner that day. Ideally the hotel should have made alternate arrangements for free in-room dining in such situations. But I was told that in-room dining would call for additional charges. Though I wanted to retire early for the day, I had to simply wait until 10.30 pm for a table in the dining area, and all just for a very simple meal. The room was also not well-equipped...i had to ask for…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Amazing Art! But declining hotel.,3,"I stayed at this hotel last year for a business trip and was really impressed. Upon returning a year later, the hotel has really started to dip. The rooms this year were stuff, smelly, dim lighting and stains on the chaise, the curtains and the countertops. There were a few dead bugs in the bathroom and the curtains were broken and would not close. There was NO hot water for 2 days. I was traveling with a group and none of us could get hot water. The breakfast buffet also went downhill. Last year it was one of my favorites in the 6 hotels I stayed at across India, this year it was toward the bottom. We had to ask for drinks multiple times. The plates and napkins were dirty and ordered food, like dosas and eggs, never arrived to the table. There were also mosquitos everywhere. I…"

Hilton Chennai,Disappointing!,3,"I am silver member and currently staying at this property for 36 straight nights.  Even though I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival requesting a room upgrade or at least allow access to the executive lounge, I was denied.  Not just that, they had the audacity to ask me to pay for my upgrade.  I booked a room with a city view and had requested a room on high floor, and I got neither.  In the past other Hilton properties went out of their way to take care of me as I am a loyal Hilton member, but not this one.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Not upto radisson standards ,3,"Stayed here for a day. It is very close the airport and they have complimentary pick up and drop to the airport. The rooms are small but well equipped. They even have a massage chair.  However the room is very cramped. The bed side tables are too small to keep anything. The room we stayed had a muggy smell , probably from the air conditioning. The breakfast served was really bad. The idlis very spoilt and the dosa was very ordinary. The service overall was good and the staff are able to anticipate our needs . …"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Not such a great visit this time ,3,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel within the space of 6 months. There are plenty of positives about this hotel but there are plenty of items that can be improved.   This hotel is huge and obviously things don't always go to plan, however for a 5 star hotel I expect service to be excellent.   This visit I was not left bottled water in the room each day without having to prompt the staff, had to wait 20 minutes in a near empty restaurant for my order to be taken and then wait nearly another 40 minutes for my omelette to appear. Whilst these are trivial items, the hotel is expensive and the service should be up to standard.   Now I did complain at the time about these items and my complaint was picked up swiftly by the management team and handled courteously and to…"

The front office staffs  are mostly friendly but the staffs at the coffee house needs to smile and be less tense.I must recommend the penne arrabiata  that was very delicious!  Overall the hotel tries to deliver the stylish interior  and concept but something  urgent needs to be done with the mold and stench.…"
The Park Chennai,"Nothing great, mediocore",3,"I stayed there for my Visa interview at chennai. The room given to me was very substandard, not at all a 5 star level. The room was at a corner and not well maintained. They have a store room or something next to the room so early morning there was lot of noise because of which my sleep was disrupted. Some staffs at counter was not helpful at all. They do not provide information about their complimentary services unless you ask them. The breakfast provided at their restaurant was just at par, could you be much better, same with the service there. They have a late checkout option which they hesitate to disclose to customers. Upon asking they say 2 pm but I could see some of their regular airline customers check out as late as 3:30pm. I would not visit them again given an option,…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai","Clean, but lack of free Wifi is not good",3,"The hotel room is clean, reasonably spacious, with a desk for working. There was a kettle in the room and free bottled water. Reasonable breakfast. There was a gym which was OK. However, in this day and age, the lack of free Wifi is not ideal. You get free 2 blocks of 30 minutes each, so free Wifi for 1 hour. But you have to use all the 30 minutes up at once each time, otherwise it is forfeited. And the connection is slow and can cut out intermittently. The internet in the Business Centre is free if  you use the computers provided. There is no free Wifi in the Business Centre. On the 1 occasion that I used the computer, it cut off after 30 minutes and asked me to log in again using the login for the Wifi.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,OK But Not Number 2 - Average Hotel,3,"Stayed here on a recent trip to India.  The hotel is close to the airport but I would not consider this to be a number 2 hotel or a 5* property.  It was just average to above average in my books.  The room was very well stocked with everything you needed etc. but just not at the 5* level.  Price was certainly cheaper.  That said, but for having to be at the airport for a 6am flight to Kochi (and it was nice to be very very close), we would have stayed at the Taj Coromandel.  Also, was there just as the second monsoon started this past October.  I did notice there was a considerable issue with mosquitos (including in the hotel), perhaps an issue noticed in Chennai generally.  It was just average in my books and between 3-4* in terms of North Amercia standards.  Buffet was just…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,A Mixed Bag,3,"Stayed recently for couple of nights. Arrived late in the evening and as luck would have it, got the room farthest from the lift! The room is pretty standard, as you would expect it to be. The lights were very dim for some reason.  Anyway, after a good night’s sleep it was time for shower. For some reason I could not get the water temperature right for more than 10 seconds continuously. It is either too HOT or too COLD and somehow refuses to stay in between. I have noticed this issue at several hotels but somehow the Radisson’s have a knack of it especially in India.   Tried the free foot massage. It was nice and soothing. The bar is OK and the beer great! The food quality is great especially when the chef can accede to your little demands like replacing the chicken with fish in…"
The Park Chennai,A rather disappointing experience.,3,"We decided to stay here owing to the comfort of access to the embassy and other places in and around the city. This was our second time at the park and we were disappointed with the service of the reception staff as they took a long long time during the check-in and check-out process.

The toiletries were inadequate for two of us. Overall, a rather disappointing experience for the amount of money spent.…"

Checkin was a bit slow. The room that i got had a door that did not close properly and the phone receiver had a musty smell. The room was also rather small and dark. Later, they moved me to another bigger room on a smoking floor. Thankfully, I did not get the smoke smell inside my room.  Room service was okay. Service at the BF buffet was downright sad.

I've never seen such a shower in any hotel! The staff in general are quite good and helpful except for the front desk staff by the name of Murugan who showed grouchiness when we inquired about room service bill.  The restaurant for breakfast can be very crowded as it is quite small so do plan ahead if you are rushing out. Food is good in both restaurant but find it quite pricey.

While the hotel staff strived to provide hospitality and convenience, the ambience is a bit impersonal. The floor boy who conducted us to the room did not bother to explain the conveniences and facilities within the room leaving us to explore and discover.  Within minutes of checking into the room, we were received by cockroaches about which we intimated to the house keeping. No one responded.

When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the travel desk to book an excursion. They had a 10h excursion on offer at reasonable price. We, however, didn't have any interest in visiting a crocodile park etc. and asked for a price to just go for 1/2 day to see the temples.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Amazing Art! But declining hotel.,3,"I stayed at this hotel last year for a business trip and was really impressed. Upon returning a year later, the hotel has really started to dip. The rooms this year were stuff, smelly, dim lighting and stains on the chaise, the curtains and the countertops. There were a few dead bugs in the bathroom and the curtains were broken and would not close. There was NO hot water for 2 days. I was traveling with a group and none of us could get hot water. The breakfast buffet also went downhill. Last year it was one of my favorites in the 6 hotels I stayed at across India, this year it was toward the bottom. We had to ask for drinks multiple times. The plates and napkins were dirty and ordered food, like dosas and eggs, never arrived to the table. There were also mosquitos everywhere. I…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Pleasant smelling hotel next to very busy road,3,"My company booked me into this hotel for an overnight stay as it was the nearest reasonably priced hotel to the airport. Facilities are limited, but it's fine for a short stay. The bar did not serve food so I had a steak sandwich in the restaurant. The restaurant staff offer a highly interactive level of service with advise on what to eat, drink and Chennai night life. I ended up drinking four sweet line soda's as the staff make the best I have tasted so far in India. My room was on the 2nd floor was very inviting despite being on the road side. The air conditioning is simple but effective and sound proofing was able to block out the 90% of road traffic noise. Guests are entitled to 30 minutes free internet, after that the hotel makes a big issue of explaining why they insist on…"

The Park Chennai,"Relic, you might as well be in a shopping mall!",3,"We were there for a couple of days in Jan making a short visit to the city as the last stop after a 3 week long tour of India.   The Good - bang in the middle of the city, enough parking for your car, big ceilings when you enter, and ... that's about it.   The not so good - a pub/bar at the ground floor that is noisy, gets noisier as the night progresses, if you wanted a quiet night after a tiring day or important day ahead, this will not help.  There was an anglo indian girl at the reception with a very poor attitude for customer service, she was doing some thing with a pile of papers and hardly could be bothered with customers waiting to be served, the rest of them did not do any better. It was like visiting a municipality office! The entrance has tall doors, I mean really…"
The Park Chennai,1 night stay,3,"I had stayed overnight between a hectic business meeting. I found the hotel to be very slow. I found many things not upto the mark. I had sent in my luggage in the morning, but when I reached late in the night, exhausted, I had to wait for a long time to only give my photo id. There were inadequate staff manning the counters as the staff were decent and helpful. In the room itself, there was 1 cup for making tea and no spoon. The morning breakfast experience was the worst. It appeared that the ""Complimentary breakfast"" was treated as a compliment by the staff. I got a table and had to ask for cutlery, water, napkin. Items like vada was over even at 9.00 am and came in after a very long time. I ordered a cup of coffee and had to remind the staff many times over 20 minutes for the…"
The Park Chennai,"Nothing great, mediocore",3,"I stayed there for my Visa interview at chennai. The room given to me was very substandard, not at all a 5 star level. The room was at a corner and not well maintained. They have a store room or something next to the room so early morning there was lot of noise because of which my sleep was disrupted. Some staffs at counter was not helpful at all. They do not provide information about their complimentary services unless you ask them. The breakfast provided at their restaurant was just at par, could you be much better, same with the service there. They have a late checkout option which they hesitate to disclose to customers. Upon asking they say 2 pm but I could see some of their regular airline customers check out as late as 3:30pm. I would not visit them again given an option,…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Wannabe Five Star Property!,3,They try very hard but this is not a five star property. At the most 4 stars. I would not stay here again. The check-in was smooth. The lobby is very unimpressive. The room is very averagely furnished. The bathroom area very badly designed. to get into the bath tub you need to go over a 16 inch thick wall. someone not very agile will injure himself or herself doing this. I was shocked to see a Squeezee Shower Gel and Shampoo Dispenser fitted on the wall a la Ibis! But Ibis has world class toiletries. This shower gel and shampoo reeked of coconut oil! Very pathetic toiletries for a Radisson in the garb of being eco friendly. The shower equipment was tough and jammed and leaking constantly. Very poor shower pressure. The air-conditioning was another horror story. The room…
GreenPark Chennai,Beware of travel desk,3,"We stayed 05//03/2011 to 07/03/2011 this hotel. Let me first say that the rooms and bathrooms are spotless, the room service is top on. Our stay was most enjoyable until check out. When have friends living nearby Chennai that advised us to visit Mahabalipuram (really recommendable). When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the travel desk to book an excursion. They had a 10h excursion on offer at reasonable price. We, however, didn't have any interest in visiting a crocodile park etc. and asked for a price to just go for 1/2 day to see the temples. They were initially totally infexible but eventually agreed and at a lesser price. They insisted it takes 2 1/2 h one way, while we know it's about 1 1/2h drive, which it was.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Average experience with some bright spots,3,"We had the most pathetic and Horrible check-in experience at ITC Grand Chola, and our sole reason to have had stayed at the hotel was Mr Amarnath (Duty Manager). It was because of his sole endeavour to address our grievance promptly and put in the corrective measures in place that we stayed at the property for 3 nights. Being a Taj Epicure member and have stayed at most premium hotels (Including ITC ones) in India and Abroad I can say that we never had worst experience at arrival anywhere else. The entire process of Luggage. Room allocation. staff courteousness at the welcome desk had been a nightmare. At arrival, there was no courteousness in the staff to offer a glass of water though there were quite many ladies standing and chatting. finally, after a wait of 20 mins, i asked…"
The Park Chennai,Good stay but service could have been better,3,"I stayed at THE PARK Chennai for two days. The rooms are nice and clean. Food is good and they do offer a variety to choose from. BUT, I was a bit disappointed at the service.  Firstly, water clogged up in wash basin. Not a good way to start with.  Secondly, the charger pins on one side of the bed was damaged. My phone charger would not plug in and when I plugged in my laptop charger, the entire room power was cut off..probably due to a short circuit. power was restored immediately though.  Then at the dining, I felt a bit ignored.  On first instance, I being alone choose to sit on a small table. After finishing off the starters, there wasn't any space left on the table to put a third plate. I got up and when came back, I was literally standing with main course in my hand and…"

GreenPark Chennai,Good Hotel...poor service,3,"I stayed at Green Park last week for 3 days for a company conference.  While the hotel itself is good, the service seems bit sketchy. Since the company had booked the conference facilities at the hotel, we got a special rate for booking rooms at the hotel. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I'd been upgraded to Business Club Room.  However, this pleasant surprise was short-lived. I came to know that while the room was being upgraded, the benefits of the room weren't! It meant that I couldn't avail the facilities and benefits that came with that category of the room. I wonder what kind of ""upgrade"" was this!!!  When I inquired about this at the reception, the folks there were clueless...what more could I have expected!!! When I requested that I speak with the…"

Taj Club House,,3,Being an Epicure Plus Gold Member - i am entitled for a free upgrade subject to availability.  I received a call from the hotel a day before for my check in time however at arrival at around 3:00pm next day i still had to wait for an hour for room to be available. Then i was informed i am being upgraded. Not happy with the room in spite of being upgraded. The room was exactly the same as i stayed last time (without the upgrade) so not clear what was upgrade all about.   Choice of TV channels is very poor. No HD channels and set-up box is very slow and outdated.  Not the experience expected from Taj Group.…

Hilton Chennai,New hotel with all Euro mod cons and a good location,3,"Very helpful staff from the airport to the room make the initial experience a good one. The hotel is new and so is still relatively quiet, not for long as it is far better than some of the other chain hotels in the region. The rooms are well appointed and modern with all the usual features and services you need as a business traveller. The gym is fairly basic with a couple of running machines and bikes, not top spec but good enough to allow you to train. The roof top pool looks great but is so close to the bar that I doubt many will use it as quite public. The roof top bar is very well designed and laid out although the service was patchy. The 3rd floor bar and restaurants are very good, wide choice and friendly service. The air con was an issue in my 9th floor room as it really…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Mixed Opinion,3,"With a view to accommodate my newly wed daughter and son-in-law in a top-class centrally located hotel, I had booked them from 18th Nov, 2016 evening to 23rd Nov, 2016 morning.  While the hotel staff strived to provide hospitality and convenience, the ambience is a bit impersonal. The floor boy who conducted us to the room did not bother to explain the conveniences and facilities within the room leaving us to explore and discover.  Within minutes of checking into the room, we were received by cockroaches about which we intimated to the house keeping. No one responded. When the guests experienced it again the second day, they had to forcefully lodge a complaint followed by pest control spraying in the presence of the guests.  On the day prior to checking out, my daughter (who was…"

The main lobby is rather far away from the main entrance - this is a humongous property. The check in was smooth.  The rooms were nice and facing the huge swimming pools. The bathroom was large. However, I need to mention that they are not as nice as the ITC one rooms at the ITC gardenia at Bangalore. This being a new hotel, they have Ipads to control everything from lighting, TV to opening the door in the room. The calls to room service, concierge, housekeeping are all routed through the 'welcome assistance' making it an irritating experience. Many times the…"

Get dropped off at one which is the main lobby and of course its the wrong one. Btw the hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport and you can take an Uber here for around Rs 200.  Walked over to the towers lobby to get checked in. The hotel itself is actually gorgeous! Just very royal. Well put together and massive....easy to get lost in. Beautiful architecture. Check in is smooth and was upgraded to a Chola suite due to my Platinum status. Suite itself is just gorgeous. And massive! Like the wardrobe in the room is bigger than most rooms bathrooms massive.

Safety: The hotel tries to maintain safety standards - rooms are sanitized and clean, and so are the public areas.. but the rules followed by other five star hotels are much stricter..  for example: Here, At the entrance, your luggage is neither checked nor sanitized, The entrance doors by themselves are not Covid safety friendly - since hundreds of hands push them on a daily basis- not sure how often the entrance handles are sanitized, the  step on sanitizer dispensers at a couple of places werent working properly, masks did not seem to be mandatory for guests…"

The breakfast buffet  offers a good spread of items and also great taste. The meal quality is also fine. The only suggestion would be to drop the room rentals a little bit considering that the delhi property traded at 6100 for a double occupancy , while chennai not a premier one traded at 6700 for a tripple occupancy. Rest all great. Sundar Narayan…"
GreenPark Chennai,Local hotel,3,"This is a typical Indian style hotel. The room is spacious and clean with light musky smell all the time.

I've never seen such a shower in any hotel! The staff in general are quite good and helpful except for the front desk staff by the name of Murugan who showed grouchiness when we inquired about room service bill.  The restaurant for breakfast can be very crowded as it is quite small so do plan ahead if you are rushing out. Food is good in both restaurant but find it quite pricey. As for the location, it is located at one of the busiest street next to Forum Mall. Shopping can be convenient although i find it is…"

For example in billing there is a serious problem. The coffee shop took so long to get the bill , despite repeated requests one noon time that we had to start walking out. More seriously ,the room was being paid for by us through the travel agent who had given us a voucher, which explicitly covered the third bed. Despite that more than half an hour was wasted at the time of check out because Reception insisted on charging us for the third bed , before it could be sorted out.

Taj Club House,Average hotel. Taj experience lacking. ,3,"We stayed at Taj Club House for 3 nights recently. To begin with, the hotel did not have the feel of a Taj property. Even though it was Christmas time, the hotel looked dull. The rooms had hard beds and average interiors. We weren't that comfortable with such hard mattress so asked our room to be changed. This process took more than 24 hours and after that we were told that all rooms have the same mattress. Coming to the service, whenever we asked for anything( bath towel, bath robe, coffee mugs etc), the housekeeping staff always got the things in lesser quantities than asked for. For e.g.single.towel, single mug, single dental kit  etc. The hotel is conveniently located near many commercial and shopping areas like T Nagar. However on my next visit I would prefer similar…"

Taj Club House,A good property but doesnt live up to being called a Taj,3,I stayed here on business visit from 30th July t0 1st Aug. The property is good but the service is not up to the mark as other Taj Properties. The promptness of service or the warmth of welcome was not there. The only thing I really loved was the swimming pool on the terrace which was an experience.…
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Every picture tells a story,3,We have just stayed at this hotel and it quite simply is not 5 star. We moved from the ITC Hotel where we were very happy but we had previously planned to move to the Hyatt due to the fact they advertised washer/dryer. After much travelling we needed to wash our clothes in a washing machine! It turned out the washer/dryer advertised was the sink in the bedroom and the hair dryer!!! During our needless stay we were constantly itchy with our skin being Irritated by dust. We asked for a deep clean for our bedroom but it didn't improve. You will see from the pics I was bitten extensively in my bed on the last night. Swimming pool was in poor repair as you can see! Plus points was the airport liaison manager and the staff at the front door and the beautiful lobby. I hate complaining…

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",2 night hotel stay in Chennai,3,A quick trip in & out of Chennai but as per last time a very pleasant stay at the ITC Grand Chola. Staff very friendly & extremely helpful. Even though it is huge the staff will always ensure you never get lost. It has obviously been a grand hotel (as the name suggests) in days gone by but there are signs of wear & weariness in the rooms. Still very clean but aged.…
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",comments,3,"1. The windows are not absolutely sound-proof. I was staying in 806 (17-23OCT) and was not comfortable with traffic noise outside.Our colleague from Denmark (Torben Hyldeqvist) was staying on same side (306) was very unhappy about the same. His room was never changed to higher floors or other side of the hotel, in spite of a direct request from him.  2. Two of the reception staff were absolutely unprofessional... we do understand that one needs to say 'No' at times, But the body language / words used were quite unethical & unprofessional. The security staff at the gate / main entrance of the hotel were not attentive & valueing presence of a foreigner with us. Either we or own own car driver was doing a duty of guard to promptly open the car doors upon arrival.  Just to keep you…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Not such a great visit this time ,3,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel within the space of 6 months. There are plenty of positives about this hotel but there are plenty of items that can be improved.   This hotel is huge and obviously things don't always go to plan, however for a 5 star hotel I expect service to be excellent.   This visit I was not left bottled water in the room each day without having to prompt the staff, had to wait 20 minutes in a near empty restaurant for my order to be taken and then wait nearly another 40 minutes for my omelette to appear. Whilst these are trivial items, the hotel is expensive and the service should be up to standard.   Now I did complain at the time about these items and my complaint was picked up swiftly by the management team and handled courteously and to…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Hotel with a Grand Look,3,"The Hotel does not live up to it's star rating. On entry one gets hit by a crowded area full of people who are non residents and have come to attend a conference....very unusual for a residential hotel. The check in was good however, we did not realize that we were upgraded (as per the check in executive) to a serviced apartment from the main hotel....we should have checked the upgrade before accepting it as the services in the apartment area were average (room amenities eg the service booklets were old, the room delivery of water was left outside the door and not even handed over, no room turn down etc. The SPA services are great. Restaurants like Peshawari and Pan Asian are very good. Breakfast area is very tight seating....almost uncomfortable. Mercara Lounge service is…"
The Park Chennai,Avoidable Overpriced Hotel,3,"Very disappointing place. I believe the Hotel was built on an earlier Gemini Studio property. The corridors and rooms are lined with old movie posters. Unfortunately, it gives the entire place some very gloomy, seedy looks. Owners seem to have cut corners while designing the rooms. Toilets have just been squeezed into the rooms. Furniture looks cheap.  Ironically, I had stayed at the Hyatt the previous night and shifted here next night due to its proximity to my workplace. And the contrast could not have been starker.  I would recommend going for any other 5 stars in Chennai as this hotel is no comparison to the rest even though its pricing is nearly similar to Hyatt's. The only consolation was the Breakfast spread which was not too lavish but still ofacceptable quality.…"
GreenPark Chennai,Manager needs to wake up and engage with hotel guests,3,"I had previously given a very good score for this hotel, but this time round, I was disappointed. When I am writing ‘not so good’ reviews, I always start with the positive aspects of our stay: 1.	The service at restaurant was exceptional; staff were very well trained, and the food was so delicious. The restaurant manager, Mr Senthil Kumar was always on the ground, and I think this made all the difference.. 2.	The concierge/ bell boys were also very helpful and go out of the way to assist us. The best part is, we had the feeling that their service was sincere and rendered without much expectations... We travelled as a big group (7 adults in 3 rooms), and had several unpleasant encounters and I will fault the hotel management for this : 1.	Upon checking in, we were given free…"

The Park Chennai,A rather disappointing experience.,3,"We decided to stay here owing to the comfort of access to the embassy and other places in and around the city. This was our second time at the park and we were disappointed with the service of the reception staff as they took a long long time during the check-in and check-out process. The room was okay but the restrooms need an immediate make-over. They look overused and the leakage in the pipe under the sink was not fixed prior to the assigning of the room. The toiletries were inadequate for two of us. Overall, a rather disappointing experience for the amount of money spent.…"

The Park Chennai,Rooms need renovation,3,"The 5 star tag doesn't apply to rooms - they have look of a 3 star property and need makeover badly. I don't why this is sold as a 5 star hotel. Gym facility, restaurant, bar are all pretty good but rooms are just bad. I suggest you stay someplace else till they get them fixed. Front desk service ain't of 5 star quality as well.…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Decent value for money,3,"I stayed for a night while en route to elsewhere on 17.03.2014. The airport pick-up and drop-in services were on-time and comfortable. Check-in and check-out were efficiently handled. The room service was prompt and to the point.   However, the service in the brunch buffet at Garden Cafe was the poorest I've experienced when comparable to restaurants of equal repute, being staffed with quite young chaps who looked and sounded clueless. The ambience was ruined by a bunch of ""newly-employed-in-IT-and-not-so-well-behaved"" clientele who seemd to have fasted for days just for this occassion and not have regards for other clients. Well, I'm no one to judge them, but my suggestion is to increase the prices two-fold.  The dinner at the 24 hour restaurant/cafe near the lobby was a…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Good and proximal to the airport,3,"We have so far had the experience of staying in lemon tree hotels in delhi and chennai. The hotels are maintained very well and offer well appointed rooms for staying. The general hygeine is great  and the staff is extremely courteous and responsive. The breakfast buffet  offers a good spread of items and also great taste. The meal quality is also fine. The only suggestion would be to drop the room rentals a little bit considering that the delhi property traded at 6100 for a double occupancy , while chennai not a premier one traded at 6700 for a tripple occupancy. Rest all great. Sundar Narayan…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Not their usual level of service ,3,To begin with the check in was pretty slow. This was also due to some unruly guests who did not bring their ID proof with address and kept on barging in while the staff was doing my check in. But I thought the staff should have politely asked to them to wait rather than trying to manage both & not able to do that.   The room was small but comfortable with all the basic amenities present. The Wifi was fast & ensures that I finish my work fast.   I went to the swimming pool in the evening around 815 pm. It’s an open air pool and one of the smallest pool I have seen. The temperature of the water was very comfortable.  But I could see that the picture water was not clean as there were dust sediments floating over the water. Also the pool was completely unattended. While I was…
Hilton Chennai,Ayla Restaurant in Hilton Chennai,3,"Myself, my wife and son had visited your Vasco Restaurant,at Hilton,Chennai this evening(07-May-2011) for dinner. We all enjoyed the food and services.   However, after the dinner when we requested for mouth freshners, we were informed that it is available only in Room Services. I was shocked by this reply. In fact we regularly go for dinners and also as room guests at ITC group, Taj etc and we always use to get mouth freshners at their Restaurants. In room services, we get all dental kit, shaving kit etc. But the first time in your Hotel that mouth freshners are available in Room services and not in restaurant.  I think if   Hotel is only to cater to foreigners and not for Indians, they may very well remove all the Indian dishes from their  menu also mention Indians are not…"
GreenPark Chennai,I can’t accept that this is a 5 star property,3,"We booked two rooms for a short stay and requested for an interconnected room.   We arrived around 10am and as expected the rooms weren’t ready, we were fine with this as understood getting both the rooms ready for that time would be a challenge. Nonetheless we were given both our rooms by around 11:15 and whilst we waited we were offered nice coffee which we were grateful for.   Some things which we disliked  Smell - from the time you enter the hotel and from everywhere in the hotel (not in the rooms) there is a lingering smell which isn’t pleasant. I think this is caused by the water feature they have on the ground floor and then on the first floor as well, but I may be wrong.   Lighting - The hotel lobby is poorly lit and feels empty. We love big hotel lobbies which are well…"
Hilton Chennai,Disappointing!,3,"I am silver member and currently staying at this property for 36 straight nights.  Even though I emailed the hotel prior to my arrival requesting a room upgrade or at least allow access to the executive lounge, I was denied.  Not just that, they had the audacity to ask me to pay for my upgrade.  I booked a room with a city view and had requested a room on high floor, and I got neither.  In the past other Hilton properties went out of their way to take care of me as I am a loyal Hilton member, but not this one.  My work will bring me to Chennai often and rest assured I will never stay at this property again.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent if you can tolerate the Mosquitos,3,Stayed there from 06 to 09 March 2013 . Impressive property indeed. The rooms were comfortable and the I pad guide was very handy. The motion sensors of the night lamp in my room No 2428 had malfunctioned the first Night in that it kept flickering even when I was motionless. Resultantly I could not sleep the first Night. I had to then figure out a way of disconnecting it. The next two nights were then dedicated to the Mosquitos. Slept well after I checked out.…

The Park Chennai,Friendly and helpful but a bit run down,3,"We stayed in The Park for a weekend in Chennai to get over jet lag on the way to Kerala.  We had a special deal that gave us breakfast and free internet access.  However, for a nominally four-star hotel the rooms were relatively small and and a bit run down.  We did find a cockroach running around on the desk.  Although that is probably hard to avoid completely in a tropical climate, one would hope that this could be avoided in a four-star hotel.    The lobby is nice and spacious and the staff try to do their best to help but are not always very efficient.    The breakfast is buffet style and the selection is reasonable and, like many hotels in India, prepare an omelet to taste.  However, this was one of the best omelets that we had.  The tea and coffee come milky and…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Pleasant Stay!,3,"We had booked two ITC one rooms. The first impression of the property is Wow. They have a different entrance and reception to the ITC one and tower rooms which is right near the entrance of the hotel - makes it convenient. The main lobby is rather far away from the main entrance - this is a humongous property. The check in was smooth.  The rooms were nice and facing the huge swimming pools. The bathroom was large. However, I need to mention that they are not as nice as the ITC one rooms at the ITC gardenia at Bangalore. This being a new hotel, they have Ipads to control everything from lighting, TV to opening the door in the room. The calls to room service, concierge, housekeeping are all routed through the 'welcome assistance' making it an irritating experience. Many times the…"

Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The hotel is in south Chennai, a short drive from the airport, but not convenient if your work is in central Chennai. There is a lot of traffic and construction work on the road to the city centre.  The exterior of the hotel is very grand, the building is massive, the architecture makes it looks like an ancient palace. Things get a bit confusing as you drive into the hotel grounds as you have to drive all the way around the building, past 3 entrances on each side to the entrance on the 4th side of the hotel.  The lobby also is very…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Good but with blemishes,4,"Well, in general pretty good but too far from perfection to be considered ""luxury"". I had a ""luxury room"" and this was pretty small like in any 3 star hotel or even smaller. What is really good is the gym which is double the size you usually get and very well equipped.  They try to do everything right and invest a lot in guest satisfaction but are not always successful: - There are plenty of waiters during breakfast but they sometimes just ignore you and you really have to hunt them to get coffee refills. - The bar closes at 11 and the music is sometimes so loud you can't understand a single word. - You can't take your drinks outside to the lobby because it is forbidden. - Housekeeping often forgets something: sometimes there is no water, sometimes there are no fruits... - The…"

We mostly stayed to lounge and swim at the Pool and dine at 601's delicious offerings from Sushi to various eclectic selections not easily nor reasonably priced if available in Chennai city at that time.  The staff were always friendly, very accomodating yet knew where to leave us alone to enjoy our meal.   601 had wide buffet selections. Ambience was superb in modern natural wood, glass and leather furniture.   For a while, there was the Japanese cuisine buffet brunch table full of succulent Sushi Sashimi and other Japanese fare. Man, 601 was heaven on earth.  The rooms were smart, contemporary, minimalist and clean.   Enjoyed immensely.   Highly recommend…"

The buffet they served for breakfast was exhaustive ranging from continental cuisine, north indian to south indian. And it was delicious!  A very good hotel but lacks in its maintenance. Its an old property but it should be maintained as one of the lifts got stuck and emergency call had to be made...  Need to mention about the pool as well.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",My maiden visit to the ITC Grand Chola,4,"I was in Chennai on business and I was booked into this hotel. For starters, the very name GRAND Chola is really apt and you only realise it as you drive up to the hotel. The hotel is over such a large property and it has three entrances. I had to be driven around to the third and had a chance to take in how large this property is.  Once inside the hotel, the very wide meandering stairway, the very wide halls combined with the lack of a crowd in the lobbies could easily leave a guest feeling rather alone and perhaps lost.  The front desk staff were quick to hand me my room card and pointed in the direction of the elevator. Once inside the room, you realise how big the rooms are. Phew !! its simply massive. I managed a quick 45 session at the gym which had everything I wanted. …"

The rooms are spacious(if its a tower room) and if you have a baby who crawls. While the fridge in the room had broken down and therefore the food we carried for the baby was spoilt.. However, we had some lovely assistance from the housekeeping and in room dining team especially when it came to baby food. The chefs understood the anxiety of a mom travelling with a baby and created some nutritious dal bhaat/khichadi/porridge recipes for our baby.  thanks to MAdras Pavilion and CHef Nikhil and Chef Padma. One of the days I was craving home made Rasam and rice with potato roast and Voil the Chefs churned that for us too! Kudos.!   We also celebrated the baby's birthday in a…"
Hilton Chennai,Very Friendly Staff,4,This was my first time visiting India and the staff at the Hilton Chennai defiantly added to the experience. As others have said there is a lot of building work going on right outside the hotel but once you step through the door you cannot hear any of the construction work or the traffic.   Check in was in the early hours of the morning and I was shown to the large room by the receptionist. I often struggle to get to sleep the first night in a hotel but the beds and pillows were very comfortable and getting a good nights sleep was not a problem.

Stayed in room 123 which was large with a shower and Jacuzzi bath. Lots of bottled water available in the room which was a nice touch.  We ate in the main restaurant area which catered well for our Western tastes, especially the awesome stilton pizza.   All staff were helpful, especially Rajavel who was always seeking ideas from us on how to improve the hotel in any way, obviously cared for our honest opinions. He is a credit to this hotel, a positive proactive employee.  The only negative I can think of was the cab ride to a business we had to travel to, an 80km trip. The cab was arranged through the hotel, I showed a copy of the address to the driver and relevant hotel employee and was…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Enjoyed my stay,4,"I stayed here for one night. The reception area is quite clear n clean, with a smiling & helpful staff. They have a pool, which I couldnt enjoy.  There is a good gym available 24x7 usage, which again I didnt try. The restaurant is quite well made, with a good choice of tasty food for breakfast. The room was quite big and very clean.  I liked the modern & abstracts hung on the wall, giving the overall property a trendy look.  At many places you will find funny quotes and articles.  The bathroom was just apt, with basic essentials.  Free wifi is offered only for 1 hour, which they have put a justification paper at reception (pay as you use)!  Overall I liked the property.…"

GreenPark Chennai,Exceptional Hospitality at Greenpark Hotels in South India,4,"I have been staying in Greenpark Chennai for the last few business visits, a little over a year. However I have experience of the same hotel in Hyderabad and Vizag as well. They are all exceptional in customer service. I remember a few years back I arrived at Greenpark Vizag with a bad cold with running nose, sore throat etc. The bell boy who was escorting me to the room, asked me politely, in good English whether I need any medicine? On my replying that I have already taken some, he said, ""Ok sir I shall send you warm water for drinking"". And it was there in my room within 5 minutes.I was moved. In my experience of so many 5 star hotels in and out of India I had never seen this kind of intelligent personal care. Chennai Greenpark is very good property, with a big spacious…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","ITC Grand Chola: Great Expectations ; belied a little, but Overall a Great Hotel!",4,"April 3, 2014  to April 4, 2014	(one night)  Room No. 2803  So guys! For those who have read my earlier review on Hyatt Regency Chennai, I had said that the next time I will be in Chennai I would try the ITC Grand Chola. Seems the opportunity has come sooner than expected so here I am in Chennai, putting up for one night at the ITC Grand Chola.  At the outset, the rack rate given to us of Rs 8,900 per night (including breakfast), I think, was way too high. Finally, some negotiations by my dept. secy. yielded some results and I got a ‘corporate rate’ of Rs. 7,600 including breakfast; taxes over and above). This is still higher than the Rs. 6,500 for Hyatt Regency, but I can live with this rate.  The Hotel, per se, is massive, to say the least. The management also ensures that you…"

From the welcome to the therapy, you feel luxury fall in your lap with some reasonable pricing, which works for all of us. The Siddh Spa and Fitness Centre at Hyatt Regency Chennai provides the guests and members an oasis of luxury. A first–of-its-kind spa concept, inspired from the 10,000 year old Siddha – Siddh Spa is the complete path to well-being.  I give it a 5 on 5 with the services, cleanliness and the welcome.  Thank you Hyatt Regency and Dinesh Goswami :)…"
The Park Chennai,Business Stay in Park Chennai,4,"The hotel is located bang on the center of the city and is an iconic place in the city as almost everyone seems to know about this place. The US consulate was almost a stone throw away from the hotel but I would warn you about the super crazy traffic you need to cross before getting there.  Was made to wait for the rooms when I arrived at the hotel and came to know that their check in time was only 2 PM but I had made it to the hotel by 8. Was informed about the approx. wait time for my room and was also offered alternatives as they were completely full (came to know that this is quite the situation day in day out). Was provided with a code to access the internet but was valid only for 2 hours.  Tried the coffee shop for breakfast, where the filter coffee was an amazing…"
Taj Club House,Great service and hotel.  Some minor issues,4,"Overall, this hotel is fantastic.  Great service, and good facilities make this a winner.  This is a new hotel, and none of the cab or rickshaw drivers had heard of this hotel.  So it took us a while to find the location.  The service is great, and everyone is really helpful.  I would especially recommend the pool staff, as they brought out cold water bottles for everyone at the pool regularly.  They also had a cart with games, books and other miscellaneous stuff on it for entertainment.    The restaurants are decent, not great.  Only Kefi, the Mediterranean restaurant was excellent.  The Indian restaurant was a hit and miss, and the buffet is very standard.   I did like the service at the Indian restaurant though, and they were very helpful is assisting us and customizing the…"
Hilton Chennai,Business with luxury..,4,"I stayed overnight at this hotel for a meeting last weekend. The hotel is very conveniently located for those travelling to Chennai for meetings- it is only 15 mins from the airport. The lobby is beautifully designed. Rooms are spacious and very well equipped with modern facilities and amenities. The staff is helpful and courteous, and the service standard excellent throughout the hotel.   Breakfast at the coffee shop was replete with numerous choices, Indian and western. It's only in India that a buffet  breakfast comes with service on the table, I think!  Good place to stay…"
Hilton Chennai,Great Hotel but a bit isolated,4,"Always a warm welcome here a stylish hotel with an impressive lobby and great rooms. Was upgraded to a junior suite as well - very nice. Only down side is it is in the middle of nowhere you have to get a Taxi to go anywhere. While in town take a cab to the beach, and wander around the side streets there for an authentic taste of India. Don't be afraid to try one of the restaurants also - many look like bare halls but they will server you a variety of curries served on a banana leaf, delicious dosas and other tasty morsels and you will struggle to pay more than $5 for a feast. Get used to eating with your hands - no utensils provided ! You will be astonished at the prices as well - my rate was under $100 per night with Breakfast…"

The Park Chennai,Costly stay,4,"As expected from a Park hotel, the stay is too costly. But they provide all the facilities equivalent to the cost.

Food is a bit expensive. Well located near to the business needs. truly Park!...…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Excellent hotel, but beware of lack of initiative ;-)",4,"Excellent hotel. Fantastic food. Only reason for not giving a 5* rating is the simple fact that we had to wait 90 min for our waiting taxi when leaving because the hotel has two gates and the staff at these two gates clearly do not coordinate well so when asking if a car was waiting we just got a no.  For future reference to any guests, please do not assume staff will act independently and solve problems on their own. You need to take the initiative and explicitly tell the person exactly what you wish them to do. We assumed that raising the problem would result in a solution. There is an abundance of staff, but coordination could be better ;-) Otherwise, amazing place and excellent food. Really nice 5th floor swimming pools.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good Hotel with a scope to improve on food!!!,4,"I recently stayed at this Hotel. I am Hyatt Gold Passport member and have always had a Hyatt image in mind as a strong brand. This hotel too has a lot to offer in terms of comfort, ambiance, helpful and courteous staff and ofcourse Great rooms!!  What they fell short of is quality of food and kind of menu served in the Spice Haat restaurant. Having stayed in different Hyatt properties across the country and abroad as well I feel they have long way to go in terms of food. I found the menus to be average and not very exciting for someone who's looking forward to a great meal after a long day at work.  e.g. I complained on the first day of visit that coconut chutney was ""hot"" due to amount of green chillies in it so the Chef needs to be make it a bit mild...second day again I asked…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Hyatt Hospitality,4,"Short Stay, 2 nights for a business trip. Quite near to the hotel, approximately 40 mins to reach there. I had requested for a hotel pick up and I would suggest that the receiver of the guest would actually have the guest names on the signage. I ended up paying for pre paid cab & after the transaction a man with a Hyatt board came up. The hotel is entrance is already making an impression w/ a cool huge art hanging. The check in was pretty quick & we were upgraded to  room that was just oh so nice. Living room + a work place + a clean bathroom + a comfy looking bed ( pillow was not that great though). Breakfast was okay. Generally, the staff of the hotel is very helpful (specially the one in business center). The lobby area is very bright due to a cool rooftop they have, just…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",A very well appointed hotel in the centre of Chennai,4,We were very well received by staff on arrival at the hotel after a long-haul flight – even at 0500 hours in the morning. One of the Reception Desk staff members (Shalom) very kindly showed us around the hotel and explained the various restaurants and facilities. The room (one if the ITC Chola rooms) was well appointed and we settled in comfortably for a short sleep before the day started. We started our day with a visit to the Madras Pavilion for a buffet lunch and found this to have a wide range on Indian and International foods. Waiting staff were very attentive – perhaps too much so and we felt at times that we were being watched whilst eating. We had breakfast the next morning at the same venue and found it to be somewhat hectic with large numbers of guests all vying for…

Taj Club House,Exceeded Expectations!,4,"As a resident of Chennai I had not stayed here earlier but had the opportunity last week when I had to stay over for an official meeting. have been to the excellent coffee shop several times earlier and to the Indian restaurant which are both excellent but the rooms were really a big surprise. Being the least known among the Taj properties in Chennai, it was great to see that the rooms and service are right up there with the other Taj Hotels in the city! Food at the buffets, set up for our group were also excellent with the sea food in particular of a very high quality. The location would be ideal for business visitors from other cities...bang on Mount Road, opposite to the Spencer Plaza and a five minute walk from the Taj Connemmara, another great hotel with lots of old world…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",One of the decent hotels ever stayed!!,4,"Recently I flew down all the way from San Fransico to Chennai for a short vacation when I got a chance to stay in this hotel for the initial 2 days,   All I can say about the hotel was clean and neat, Pretty much OKAY among 4 start hotel categories.  It's actually a value for money if you book it through some deals.  Certainly, there is some room for improvement in the amenities provided. For instance, I had some wi-fi issues which got sorted out later in the morning.   Despite that, I liked their hospitality service very much. All the staffs working in this hotel were really sincere about their job duties and supportive enough.  Right from the security person, receptionists, housekeeping, Restaurant ppl were so dedicated to their work and welcomed everyone with a smile on their…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Mr Darren,4,"I stayed at the ITC Grand Chola for 6 weeks on a business trip during March/April 2018. The staff at the ITC are amazing and always willing to help, making the hotel feel like home from home. Priyanka at the travel desk was always there to sort out our taxis to and from the office ensuring they were on time and where possible the same driver each day. She was extremely friendly and able to sort out any issues professionally and promptly as well as helping us organise our weekend tours ensuring the driver was made aware of the places we wanted to visit. Jai at the coffee shop greeted us each morning and ensured my colleagues and I had our drinks ready without even having to ordering. Jai surely does make the best hot drinks in Chennai. He assisted us with meals ensuring we had…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Luxurious and large, but an airport hotel",4,"I have mixed feelings about this place. No doubt, it is HUGE and truly ""grand"" and also luxurious.  It  is yet an airport hotel and far from the city proper.  The size of the hotel can be a disadvantage - given it is so large, if you were to forget something in your room, going to retrieve it can be an arduous task in itself.  You can get lost in the property.  The restaurants are nice, the rooms are really good, and the staff, courteous.  The ipad in the room for room controls is very smart and meant to inspire awe.  However, if you have a lot of work in the city, or if you like to walk about the city streets, this is not for you.…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Pretty Good But Not Special,4,"Stayed here for 2 nights. First impressions were good, once I was able to negotiate the ground floor and get up to the atrium lobby.   The room was large with the rather interesting central wash basin unit and mirror. Large enough though perhaps more could be done with the space. My shower had an uneven floor resulting a cold puddle being left at times.   Gym was great, bright and airy with a decent range of equipment.   Breakfast / coffee shop was the highlight for me, both for the room and range of food.   Tried the Italian restaurant for a quick dinner. It wasn't cheap but the quality was very good.   Service - as you'd expect from Hyatt, fast and efficient.   Overall, enjoyable stay, but having stayed at the Leela recently for the same length of time, not quite at the same…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Good hotel near Chennai airport,4,"We stayed there just for one night as we arrived late in the evening and we were flying again from Chennai airport the following morning.  Our stay was very good as upon arrival to the airport a Hotel representative was waiting for us, then after a couple of minutes we got the Hotel car and in just 10 minutes we were in the lobby. Check in was almost fine, although they didn`t read my e-mail properly prior to arrival telling them that I had booked 2 rooms, and then my colleague had to go through the whole booking process again.  Room although started to show its age was very comfortable and with all the things you may need there. Internet connection was fine and I could connect more than 1 device to the wifi system.   Breakfast was also good and with enough selection of food and…"
The Park Chennai,"Good location, dining options and staff",4,"Right in the heart of the CBD, shopping areas and within walking distance to the United States Embassy ...location is the hotel's greatest asset.  However  like all centrally located hotels be prepared for traffic congestion and noise while entering and exiting.  The hotel is built on the grounds of the erstwhile Gemini Studios, and the contemporary look of the hotel which is bright and funky  is mixed with retro-posters of old films in the rooms and corridors,   This is now beginning to look worn out and faded.  Rooms are fairly large, comfortable and clean but again need a facelift, views are not great, most overlook an  abandoned building. Bathrooms are old fashioned and there were patches of peeling paint.  By way of dining options, there is a  good Thai restaurant worth…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Live like a modern Chola,4,"Take time out when you visit this one. Possibly one of the most eagerly anticipated hotel openings in recent times in India, ITC’s Grand Chola has been in the making for the better part of the last decade. As it finally opens, I got some sneak previews of the hotel, and though it is far from complete, and only partially open, there are already glimmers of what lies ahead.    It is India’s largest hotel in floor area, and built to scale. Located in Guindy, on the way to the airport, it should be accessible to business travelers easily. It’s a massive structure, and the numbers just reinforce it.  It’s a 600-room hotel, spread over 1.5 million square feet in an eight acre plot. It has 100,000 square feet of banqueting and convention space which includes 30,000 square feet of…"

The rooms are massive , well decorated, with all the creature comforts one can think of, like AC, bath tub, shower cubicle, toiletries and in room mini bar and coffee /tea making facilities.

No expected of a hotel which can be rated a 3 to 4 star. Although I had requested for a king sized bed, I was given two small queen sized beds. Although there was a swimming pool, it was not functional. The home service was good and the food served though expensive was very tasty. The complimentary breakfast was good and met our expectations. I was also invited by the customer service about special mexican food festival.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,A foodies Paradise,4,"Since I am a local my chance of staying in this lovely hotel is a nought. but Hyatt regency is one of the best hotels in Chennai. The place is big, the lobby is reaaally spacious, the restaurants here takes the cake. The Styx is on the the best oriental restaurant I have been to to and I have been to quite a few all over the world. This place has carved a place for itself in my mind. The presentation, the taste, the variety are amazing the only minus if I have to is the portions of the food. Usually the portions given in a 5 star hotels are very generous but here is would not say it is generous. The Spice haat is another place where one can enjoy the indian food which is at its very best. One of the best buffets in Chennai is on show here. The desserts are amazing with its taste…"

GreenPark Chennai,Welcome Home,4,Greenpark is one of those gems offering @ home feeling. It is located on the most crowded part of the city - the vadapalani area near the kollywood studios. (You will get to see lot of small time celebrities when u visit this hotel). In my opinion they have the best staff in the city - they make you feel @ home.  The rooms are good with wooden flooring - although they could improve a little with the interiors. The bathroom is quite small. They dont keep the soap instead shower gel!!! The Wifi is free and good! The room service tastes good and presented well (they cover rotis individually in butter paper). This hotel has some of the best restaurants in town. They even have a barbecue by the pool - but chennai is quite sultry will make you sweat until you are soaked.  The even…

Wifi network is average. -Staff is extremely kind and helpful. -Dry cleaning services are excellent and affordable. -They have an additional bar and a club in the hotel premises both of which are also favorites amongst locals - and are full over the weekends. The pool and gym meet an average standard. The hotel facility is by itself very entertaining for a day or two. - The FOB here at their restaurant ""601"" is what makes me write a review today and deserves a special mention. An excellent and a non-repetitive variety(which is…"
The Park Chennai,"Centrally located and good bar/club, music and food",4,"This is Dr. V Reddy from the USA, I stayed here for two weeks last month July 2015, while on vacation and taking care of some personal business as well. Since I have not visited Chennai in the summer for many years, I was delighted that the AC in this hotel is very good to relax during the day heat. However, the cons are old infrastructure, elevators and rooms which they seem to be fixing. Pros are the location is great for friends and family to visit, and good food and night life. Couple of staff deserve special mention as they personally took interest in providing good service and paid attention to details for eg, fixing the safe when power was out or getting me an umbrella when uthe monsoon rain poured. Thank you to both Sreejith from front desk and Ankit, the front leather…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",NIce property but needs maintainance,4,"The Grand Chola, as the name states, is very Grand and a humongous property.  We were staying in the 2 bedroom Service Apartment  and though connected to the Hotel, was a bit f a walk to the reception area, but taking into account the huge property, this would have been from other areas also. The staff were courteous, but the check in took a lot of time. They need to increase the check in counters taking into account the no of rooms they have.4 check in counters are not sufficient.  overall a nice experience and one needs to stay here to experience the Hotel.  A must visit in my book.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Very Grand... Very Complex,4,"I stayed here from 30 April - 02 May 2014. This is the second time I stayed at this hotel. This place is very grand and opulent at every step. you will easily get confused if you are not familiar. Everything is good about this place. Again as it happened at ITC Gardenia Bangalore, when I went for breakfast here, I found the cup having cracks.. of course they replaced it, but this should not happen in this kind of hotel. I appreciate the hotel staff, when they told me during breakfast that they do not advice having orange juice as it is not good/ bad quality. Overall good experience again.…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Nice experience at Radisson GRT,4,"Great experience, good service and staff, best Radisson experience so far. F&B slightly expensive compared to Chennai standards. Great Kabab Factory is good, but they should proactively offer veg also to guests having non veg. The Sunshine Food Festival was advertised and displayed well, but nobody knew how to actually opt for it. Good location 10 minutes from airport and large rooms for the price…"
GreenPark Chennai,A very pleasant stay,4,"I stayed for three nights, in a business club room. It was comfortable, but a little old, in its setup, I found the plastic shower, very strange for this type of hotel, I was staying as a bit of R&R from being in Chennai, for three weeks, I just wanted a little luxury, and it did that for me, apart from the medical conference that took over the whole hotel and made getting a coffee impossible at the coffee shop, mainly very good Indian food…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai is a compact hotel,4,"Hotel has a excellent service at a reasonable price. The staff is good and well trained. Rooms are decent with all amenities but one things I faced that was little uncomfortable was the room temp was not coming down inspite of setting the temperature at 22 deg from thermostat, it proabably was around 25 deg and was hot. The restaurants are great and they had a very good spread of breakfast. Bets part is the hotel is close to airport it is like 20min drive. It is in fact just at the end of the runway.…"

Taj Club House,Contemporary Club House,4,This Taj property located in the heart of the city is equipped with the paraphernalia to cater to the requirements of business travelers. The Superior room is on the smaller side and one could compare it to the size of hotel rooms in Hong Kong. The glass casing that surrounds the bathroom compromises on your privacy if you are sharing the room with a work colleague or a friend. This is surprising considering the USP of the hotel is to target the business traveler. A proper mist glass would be better than whats in place currently. Service (House Keeping & Room Service) as one would expect from Taj Group is top notch. The maximum volume in the television has been set at 18 to avoid noise pollution and disturbance to others. The pool located on the roof top (7th floor) is clean and…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent hotel with one weak spot,4,"In general was a fantastic hotel -- the pool area was one of the nicest I've experienced in Indian hotels.  I had a Towers Room (entry-level) and it was excellent -- the I-Pad controls for the room worked well.  We worked through the weekend, so we used several of the restaurants, all were very good - good service and good food.  The hotel is large with an incredible amount of Marble, and the staff is keeping it in first class shape.   The only issue I had was with the front desk staff -- they seemed like they were trained and managed by a different team.  My check-in was with a poorly trained associate, who I happened to catch the next morning and he was unable to even comprehend how he would find the conference room that my assistant had reserved, he didn't know and didn't see…"
The Park Chennai,A good business hotel,4,"Have stayed in The Park twice on my official trips and kind of like the hotel. The lobby is nice and big giving you a feeling like you are in a really big place, which is not entirely true but that's a nice play.   I like the posters of old flicks in the lobbies and rooms though the posters in the room should have been better chosen. The room I stayed in had a hand drawn poster of a horror movie and that's kind of pissing off when you get up in the morning.   The breakfast is fantastic and you need to really hold yourself back if you have meetings lined up. They have lovely South Indian fare and live counters. Really really nice breakfast.   The highlight is of course the swimming pool at the terrace. It doubles up as a great outdoor lounge at night and it is great fun to laze…"

The room was big and clean.Has a good bed , a tv with all major channels subscribed , The hotel has a pool, gym and spa and has 3 restaurants ,1 bar and a pub/nightclub in its premises. A mall is located right opposite the hotel. The only thing that can be improved is the bfast buffet which provides many options but needs some improvement on the Indian options.Rooms are provided with complimentary fruit platters on demand and a few items kept in the mini bar like soft drinks , pack of chips , biscuits are complimentary too. All in all a decent stay with close access to Srvana Bhavan , Buhari , dindigal thalpakatti and a major temple…"

Made me feel extremely welcome",4,"I stayed here for 5nights on business, travelling solo and a little nervous as it was my first time in India. As soon as I walked in, the staff made me feel extremely welcome and have me the 5 star service. I stay in a lot of hotels in the uk, including hiltons, and I have to say, the uk staff should take note! Some ppl on here have commented about a damp smell: I too noticed it, although to be fair it's been 40c and extremely humid. Couple that with excellent air con and there's bound to be something that meets in the middle. Didn't bother me at all.  The q bar on the terrace was a great place to relax after a busy day, and their food was impeccable.   My honest feedback is that I didn't expect tho to be paying London prices for food. …"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Special stay with family,4,"We have a year old baby and we stayed at the Chola tower between Jan 7-12 2014. It was a good experience. The rooms are spacious(if its a tower room) and if you have a baby who crawls. While the fridge in the room had broken down and therefore the food we carried for the baby was spoilt.. However, we had some lovely assistance from the housekeeping and in room dining team especially when it came to baby food. The chefs understood the anxiety of a mom travelling with a baby and created some nutritious dal bhaat/khichadi/porridge recipes for our baby.  thanks to MAdras Pavilion and CHef Nikhil and Chef Padma. One of the days I was craving home made Rasam and rice with potato roast and Voil the Chefs churned that for us too! Kudos.!   We also celebrated the baby's birthday in a…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Great business hotel,4,"The rooms are comfortable and generally very quiet. The bathroom layout is a little strange and not conducive to privacy if there are multiple guests in one room. However, for a single occupant it is fine and the rooms are well equipped.

But the highlight of my stay at the Hyatt Regency Chennai was the dinner buffet - in particular the desserts. Quite spectacular!…"

Taj Club House,Trendy Taj ,4,"Stayed recently for two nights and truly a satisfying experience. The decor is trendy and elegant supplemented by nice ambiance. Breakfast and Dinner buffet spread at the clubhouse was terrific. Spicy chicken and the fish rolls were terrific starter. Sweet options were limited but the delicacy could not be denied. Breakfast was as usual a tasty experience with dosa, idly and sambars were superb. Only downside is the slow service not only at the restaurant but even the room service was at its new low in Taj. But Tajness was there all around with smiling and polite staffs and an elegant lounge. The roof top Mediterranean joint was billed as wonderful but not tasted yet. The gym and swimming pool (barring pigeon presence) with Spa were a huge plus at the roof top. The room I stayed…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Pleasant stay,4,"This is the ITC flagship in Chennai, a massive place with innumerable wings and lots and lots of corridors and empty spaces that will take a few days to get familiarised with.

The rooms are massive , well decorated, with all the creature comforts one can think of, like AC, bath tub, shower cubicle, toiletries and in room mini bar and coffee /tea making facilities. Beds and pillows are quite comfortable. Guests in this block can go the residents room between 6 -8 PM for complimentary beverages, both alcoholic and non alcoholic, and snacks. The service here was absolutely fantastic.  The New year eve dinner was not so fantastic. The menu was good, food was…"

The bathroom was large and very comfortable. The gym in the Hotel was great. Breakfast spread was damn good and gave a good experience.  Hotel is large and gives a very spacious feeling. Large common areas and large lobby.   Couple of points that can be improved - The bed in the room was little old hence had slight curve. Hotel should keep looking at these things and take regular change of mattress as needed. The small carpet close the bed in the room was not clean..  In general, i noticed that few scratch marks in the lifts etc.…"

Rooms are very clean and comfortable. The restaurant serves great food, the café is also a brilliant place for snacks and a drink. The Yalla Yalla Bar feels like a traditional pub, great atmosphere!

The grand chandeliers at lobby and staircase, makes it a great view to visitors. The party hall was apt for a small gathering and even the food served was sumptuous and tasty. It was pure vegetarian fare along with starters, full main course and desserts. Definitely, will visit this place next time to enjoy the fullest.…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Great Location and a Superb Hotel... small short comings,4,"This hotel is located bang on Anna salai ( mount road) with in mall complex itself.  The lobby ( may be two levels upper from ground ) is magnificent and has some of the best restaurants located on the same level. The rooms are quite clean and large... the wash room design is quite unique and well planned.  The buffet break fast is well laid out and quite a good variety. But the short comings are 1. The check in quite slow 2.The newspapers request  made at check in as desired by the staff and actual are different. 3. The welcome letter in the room was in the earlier guest.... not sure how old is that letter. 4.The bathroom amenities are not good quality... if you use the comb, certain to get blood from the scalp. 5.

The Park Chennai,Good hospitality,4,Stayed for one night at this place. There were initial hiccups with the airport transfer which we had booked along with making the reservation but for some unknown reason inspite of reminders they couldnt find the booking for the airport pick up and this was a big mess when I checked into the hotel. But the duty manger Mr. Seni was very receptive to feedback and left no stone unturned in making the rest of the stay comfortable and all issues taken care of. The ambience and location of the hotel is very good. Staff is quite courteous. I hope they can take care of the disconnect which I see with the travel desk and the reservation system.…
The Park Chennai,Did the Trick,4,"Overall, not a bad place to stay.  The reception, leather bar and restaurant are all very welcoming.  My room was clean and well presented, and allowed access to the lounge bar between 6.30-8.30 on weeknights (unfortunately I only found out about this towards the end of my stay).  The gym was also well equiped with friendly staff.  Both restaurants - 601 & the Thai one offered very good food, although the service was slightly inconsistent.    Only let-down was on the driver front, where I 'accidentally' gave my driver from the airport my mobile on arrival.  Not mentioning any names, but he called four times of Friday night, then sent numerous messages offering to take me 'site seen' and the clincher, woke me up at 7am on Saturday morning when i desperately needed a sleep-in! …"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good location for work visit,4,"I stayed here in September 2017 for a work visit. The hotel is one of those places that in photos looks amazing but in reality is maybe a tad rough around the edges - having said that probably more luxurious than alot of places i have stayed in the past! :-) The staff are very attentive, in fact probably too attentive as i tend to like to just do things for myself, i know alot of guests staying there would expect people to do everything for them though! Room was very big and well-equipt with a great view over city - it was a shame that it was all air conditioned and there was no way to open any windows to let some fresh (well as fresh as you can get in Chennai!) air in as everything ended up feeling a bit damp and musty.

The hotel has been finished to a very high standard and contains a variety of top class restaurants. Ended up staying in one of the residency rooms which was nicely fiited out but too large for one person. Being a new hotel i found a number of things still to be opened and the staff not as helpfull as other places i have stayed at in Chennai.

However, the room allocated to me was probably near the take off and landing for the Chennai airport and also near the Guindy railway station. It may have been that the room was having poor sound proofing and the take off, landing and the train whistle was very loud and heard inside the room.

Hilton Chennai,Good stay in an international style hotel ,4,Nice stay in this hotel mid December . Efficient hotel pick up ( 15' away without traffic congestion) and welcoming check in despite very much late arrival.  The room is having all what you would expect for this range of hotel . The styling of the whole room is modern but without any specific touch of India . The restaurant is offering a wide diversity of food from Indian to other origins.  The gym is to my point of view not that large and quickly booked when 4 or 5 people are in .  I did not had time to enjoy the roof top pool .... probably next time . …

Taj Club House,Overall a good stay,4,I stayed here recently while working in Chennai. I have always stayed at the currently closed Connemara so unfortunately my observations were often made with comparison to that superior hotel. The staff at Taj hotels are always friendly and professional. During our stay individuals from the American navy checked in. They were not a credit to their country and the hotel management did not seem keen to do anything about the situation. However once we had complained the management took action beyond the expected and I sincerely thank them. The negative points do seem picky but these improvements would help guests.  Improve information in rooms such as restaurant opening times and local information and a tv channel guide Give more information on the room to room dialling service…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Comfortable room,4,"Luxury hotel, very well decorated. Gym an swimming pool were perfect. Room is comfy, with sound prof windows. All info available in a tablet, where you also can control room AC/lights!  Lots of restaurant options, I had a meal at Vergara, unfortunatelly it was too spicy for my ocidental taste. I couldnt eat anything except for the desert... The staff were very considerate and offered me a plate with yogurt to help.  I had most of my meals at Mercara Cafe, with good options of sandwiches and pastas, the expresso was very nice as well. Front desk and cab service needs improvement, they need to be more dinamic and improve their way to organize the agenda, they are taking notes in a peace of paper. We booked a cab one night but the driver delayed 1h, we had to call the hotel to…"
Taj Club House,"Good stay, thanks!",4,"Comfortable stay at the Club House, helpful staff, comfortable modern room. Many use of the gym which has roof top location with good view over the city, along side pool and bar. There was a visiting DJ from Bangalore in the bar during my stay, which spiced up the hotel bar. Id return to the Club House, good airport pick up too. Only negative points were the lack of free wifi and the mosquitoes in the reception; but wouldnt put me off from going back!…"
GreenPark Chennai,REVIEW,4,Hotel was very good. The free breakfast was a plus. The location is the best being a walking distance from the new mall. The traffic in Chennai is very dense that walking around for a Western will pose a grave danger.The hotel does a good job in arranging for taxis. Restaurant services were very good as waiters are ready to offer services that diners could do for themselves. The hotel front desk has an exchange desk to take care of money exchanges.…
GreenPark Chennai,Ideal for a short Business Visit,4,"Excellent, clean rooms and great service. Excellent breakfast spread too, but could get repetitive for longer stays.  the location is good and well connected to the rest of the city.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",This one is actually Graaand..!!,4,Had company conference twice at this property and it boasts of i believe the largest pillar less banquet space in the country. The rooms are super high tech....with ipad controls for literally everything even in the base category rooms. The breakfast buffet lives upto to the class of ITC hotels with large and amazing spreads. Overall it is a superb property!!!…
The Park Chennai,Did the Trick,4,"Overall, not a bad place to stay.  The reception, leather bar and restaurant are all very welcoming.  My room was clean and well presented, and allowed access to the lounge bar between 6.30-8.30 on weeknights (unfortunately I only found out about this towards the end of my stay).  The gym was also well equiped with friendly staff.  Both restaurants - 601 & the Thai one offered very good food, although the service was slightly inconsistent.    Only let-down was on the driver front, where I 'accidentally' gave my driver from the airport my mobile on arrival.  Not mentioning any names, but he called four times of Friday night, then sent numerous messages offering to take me 'site seen' and the clincher, woke me up at 7am on Saturday morning when i desperately needed a sleep-in! …"
GreenPark Chennai,'Short but sweet'-wish it was longer!',4,"Late December 2011, we visited Chennai for a wedding, which was at the same hotel. So for convience, we stayed at Green Park. We were quite impressed with the whole experience. The rooms were spacious and  clean and the  service was very good. From the time we booked in to check out, it was handled professionally. Our stay was only for a day and I wished we had stayed longer. I would have no hesitation in staying there again.   I'm afraid I had no time to explore or experience much, where the food and other amenities were concerned. I have no doubt it would have met my expectations.…"

The Look from the outside at night is excellent. The interiors are very beautiful. Very spacious. The Entrance has a grandeur look.   I liked the Peshawari Hotel. The Kababs are excellent especially the pompfret Kabab. One full large fish satisfying 2 persons. The juices were excellent. The  lighting in the hotel provided a excellent ambiance. The Paneer Kabab was like eating cake. The Shekh Kabab was sumptuous.  Need atleast a week to go around the hotel. The best business and high segment hotel. Love to go once again…"

Hilton Chennai,Experienced the flavour of Hilton Chennai,4,"My wife and I stayed for 6 nights at the Hilton Chennai whilst having medical check ups at the MIOT Hospital which was conveniently 15 minutes away by car. I have stayed in 5 different Hilton hotels around the world & this one was amongst the best. The worst was Hilton Dubai. The strength of Hilton Chennai is through its staff. They were very warm, welcoming, humble and professional. Mr. Vinayak received us on arrival and also saw us off on departure. He was very friendly and made us felt as if we had known him for many years. There should however be more attention to the hotel maintenance with particular attention to the external walls of the building & roof top bar. This is important to maintain the 5-star status of the establishment. Mrs Divya Raheja the Assistant…"

The Park Chennai,"Centrally located and good bar/club, music and food",4,"This is Dr. V Reddy from the USA, I stayed here for two weeks last month July 2015, while on vacation and taking care of some personal business as well. Since I have not visited Chennai in the summer for many years, I was delighted that the AC in this hotel is very good to relax during the day heat. However, the cons are old infrastructure, elevators and rooms which they seem to be fixing. Pros are the location is great for friends and family to visit, and good food and night life. Couple of staff deserve special mention as they personally took interest in providing good service and paid attention to details for eg, fixing the safe when power was out or getting me an umbrella when uthe monsoon rain poured. Thank you to both Sreejith from front desk and Ankit, the front leather…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Super Luxury, but can improve",4,"For a super luxury Hotel which charges premium, there is a definite scope of improvement. On the first day the Mini Bar was not full. There is a scope of improvement of services at Breakfast table ( Madras Pavilion).   Went to Peshwari for a team lunch, the service was excellent, but the food not up to the standards of Bukhara or even Afghani ( ITC Windsor, Bangalore). The Laundry service was excellent,particularly Nalini from Fabricare.…"

It was nice to escape the hustle and bustle of an Indian city,and relax in comfort and tranquility in a high end hotel.  The airport is close, but doesn't feel like an airport hotel.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","ITC Grand Chola: Great Expectations ; belied a little, but Overall a Great Hotel!",4,"April 3, 2014  to April 4, 2014	(one night)  Room No. 2803  So guys! For those who have read my earlier review on Hyatt Regency Chennai, I had said that the next time I will be in Chennai I would try the ITC Grand Chola. Seems the opportunity has come sooner than expected so here I am in Chennai, putting up for one night at the ITC Grand Chola.  At the outset, the rack rate given to us of Rs 8,900 per night (including breakfast), I think, was way too high. Finally, some negotiations by my dept. secy. yielded some results and I got a ‘corporate rate’ of Rs. 7,600 including breakfast; taxes over and above). This is still higher than the Rs. 6,500 for Hyatt Regency, but I can live with this rate.  The Hotel, per se, is massive, to say the least. The management also ensures that you…"

Taj Club House,Trendy Taj ,4,"Stayed recently for two nights and truly a satisfying experience. The decor is trendy and elegant supplemented by nice ambiance. Breakfast and Dinner buffet spread at the clubhouse was terrific. Spicy chicken and the fish rolls were terrific starter. Sweet options were limited but the delicacy could not be denied. Breakfast was as usual a tasty experience with dosa, idly and sambars were superb. Only downside is the slow service not only at the restaurant but even the room service was at its new low in Taj. But Tajness was there all around with smiling and polite staffs and an elegant lounge. The roof top Mediterranean joint was billed as wonderful but not tasted yet. The gym and swimming pool (barring pigeon presence) with Spa were a huge plus at the roof top. The room I stayed…"
Taj Club House,Great service and hotel.  Some minor issues,4,"Overall, this hotel is fantastic.  Great service, and good facilities make this a winner.  This is a new hotel, and none of the cab or rickshaw drivers had heard of this hotel.  So it took us a while to find the location.  The service is great, and everyone is really helpful.  I would especially recommend the pool staff, as they brought out cold water bottles for everyone at the pool regularly.  They also had a cart with games, books and other miscellaneous stuff on it for entertainment.    The restaurants are decent, not great.  Only Kefi, the Mediterranean restaurant was excellent.  The Indian restaurant was a hit and miss, and the buffet is very standard.   I did like the service at the Indian restaurant though, and they were very helpful is assisting us and customizing the…"

The room size and the bathroom size are one of the biggest I have seen in all my travels till date. the room is very modern ,IPAD control is one nifty feature to control almost everything in room . free WiFi is one other feature which was very welcome (i think its complementary for a short period as the property is failry new) .  had dinner at the In- house restaurents - The Madras Pavilion & Cafe Mercara Express ,excellent personalised service ,which you can always expect at an ITC property. More restaurents are still coming up , so will have to wait till they are operational.  had foreign guests travelling with me , so the buffet choice at The Madras Pavilion was a little too South-Indian for my…"
Taj Club House,Overall a good stay,4,I stayed here recently while working in Chennai. I have always stayed at the currently closed Connemara so unfortunately my observations were often made with comparison to that superior hotel. The staff at Taj hotels are always friendly and professional. During our stay individuals from the American navy checked in. They were not a credit to their country and the hotel management did not seem keen to do anything about the situation. However once we had complained the management took action beyond the expected and I sincerely thank them. The negative points do seem picky but these improvements would help guests.  Improve information in rooms such as restaurant opening times and local information and a tv channel guide Give more information on the room to room dialling service…

The house keeping service was very good and the girl who cleaned our room (Rathi) always put a smile on our face with small gestures like decorate the floor with petals of roses in the shape of a heart really captured my heart.  The laundry service was good and fast eventhough sometime i did wonder did they really wash the clothes because of the mark of my lipstick on one of the t-shirt being there despite of 3 or 4 washes. Also there was a small problem with the laundry bill while checking out which they sorted out after bringing to their attention.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Luxurious and large, but an airport hotel",4,"I have mixed feelings about this place. No doubt, it is HUGE and truly ""grand"" and also luxurious.  It  is yet an airport hotel and far from the city proper.  The size of the hotel can be a disadvantage - given it is so large, if you were to forget something in your room, going to retrieve it can be an arduous task in itself.  You can get lost in the property.  The restaurants are nice, the rooms are really good, and the staff, courteous.  The ipad in the room for room controls is very smart and meant to inspire awe.  However, if you have a lot of work in the city, or if you like to walk about the city streets, this is not for you.…"

It ranged from casual to fine dining. I had dinner at the Italian and the seafood pasta dish was nice - although it was a little pricy. The buffet breakfast was AMAZING! I thoroughly enjoyed this every morning with so much variety and choice from Indian to hot breakfast to pastries and cereals.

Staff was extra friendly. The only draw back that we saw was the fact as SPG Gold members we were accustomed to getting access to the Lounge which in India have been really good. Unfortunately here, they pointed us to a corridor which was call the ""Upper Crest"" which could seat maybe around 20 people at the most. This was very disappointing. They did accommodate us in another Bar (which would have been better suited as the Lounge)       The Breakfast Buffet was good, but I was expecting a bit more Opulence and more verity of Southern Indian Food.

The Park Chennai,"Great Hotel, with 2 big reservations",4,"I just returned from three nights at the Park Chennai and had a mostly positive experience there. The rooms are slick and intelligently designed. Very clean but the signs of wear are beginning to show for the most discerning of eyes. The cheeky touches (Bollywood posters,  cartoons in the lift) add a bit of levity to staying in Bangalore, which can be hard work.   There are two problems with this hotel which might put off western travellers. One is security. When you enter the hotel you go through a metal detector, your body is scanned with a wand, and your bag is inspected. It's rather quick and rather perfunctory, but still a pain. I've encountered this at Taj hotels (obviously), but I am not sure why they do this.   The second issue is the hotel's bar. The Park has a very…"

Hilton Chennai,Stuck somewhere between Business and pleasure,4,"There are not too many negatives for this place.. Nice comfortable hotel, really polite and nice staff, take the breakfast.. one of the fantastic spreads for breakfast. Nice big LCD TV in the room.. Everything you can ask for.. What I think the hotel suffers is, the lack of clarity on whether it needs to position itself as a business hotel or purely as pleasure. From the location it is business, but the internet rates are obnoxious. You can get a stick for a month for the money you pay for a day. The gym is average though the trainers make some effort. The pool shuts by 7:30.. lacks a spa so it is not exactly a pleasure stay also.  One biggest negative is the water drain in the shower area. Poor design results in water accumulation when taking a shower... If you overlook it..…"

GreenPark Chennai,Strongly recommend!! ,4,Nice private entrance on the arcot road just in between the Vijaya hospital and the Forum mall with a good parking capacity that suits this hotel. Very good hospitality at the main entrance and a lovely lobby with a Buddha statue. There seems to be many areas to explore within this hotel but I have only explored the Mustang lounge bar next to the lobby and the Escape pub at the basement so far. So I will just stick to the review of these 2 places. Mustang: Nice lounge bar with a projector screen and televisions all around with friendly bar tenders. Good place to hang out with a group of friends to chat if you are not particularly looking for music or any other entertainment. Escape: The area within this hotel exactly for a person like me. Well lit pool table which first draws me…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Short comfortable  stay ,4,Stayed at the ITC One Tower for a short one night stay. Well appointed rooms which are large and controlled by an iPad in addition to normal switches.   Safety camera and unlocking of the door possible to view and use from the iPad and comfort of your bed.   Enjoyed an excellent meal at Avartana. A must visit for those who haven’t been.   A couple of morning cappuccinos brought out quickly as there was no time for breakfast.   Did have an issue with dirty water in the bath tub but the resident manager apologised and requested to overlook the same. As a human I am willing to overlook but with such branded hotels you expect something basic like water to be clean no matter what.   Staff were polite at all points of interaction.   I would certainly give this property another chance…
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good location for work visit,4,"I stayed here in September 2017 for a work visit. The hotel is one of those places that in photos looks amazing but in reality is maybe a tad rough around the edges - having said that probably more luxurious than alot of places i have stayed in the past! :-) The staff are very attentive, in fact probably too attentive as i tend to like to just do things for myself, i know alot of guests staying there would expect people to do everything for them though! Room was very big and well-equipt with a great view over city - it was a shame that it was all air conditioned and there was no way to open any windows to let some fresh (well as fresh as you can get in Chennai!) air in as everything ended up feeling a bit damp and musty.

Taj Club House,Great place and great location,4,"Ideal place to stay if you are on  official business or for visa purposes. It is on the same side of the road as the US consulate hence making it easy to reach within 5 minutes. Great hospitality,  great food and nice salon and pool. Pricing is pretty ok for the room size and quality. Very enthusiastic staff in the reception and restaurant.. worth a repeat visit.…"
GreenPark Chennai,Value for money,4,This hotel will top the list of value for money hotels not only in Chennai but perhaps even across India. Decent hotel with good service. Restaurants are good. Try first floor restaurant which is pool side and offers good food. Go ahead if you are contemplating your stay at this hotel.…
The Park Chennai,Good Stay - Near to US Consulate,4,"I stayed here back in 2010 when I came to Chennai for my US Visa procedure. The best part it is right opposite to the US Consulate in Chennai. The Rooms were clean, Food was very average. Service was Average too. As a 5 star much more was expected out of the Hotel which it failed to provide. I felt the restaurant was a bit cramped. Could have provided wifi to the guests rather than a wired internet.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent Property - Staff Needs Improvement,4,"To start with, property location and hotel is excellent. True to it's name, overall ambiance is grand. Multiple seating options placed in lobby provides good option to sit and relax.  Rooms are well kept (stayed in east wing 2446), spacious with all basic expected amenities. Controls managed through Ipad, wifi was highly priced though.  I liked the room view which was directly opposite the Pool.  Coming to Staff -- This is where it falters. At check in, we waited for 20 mins before anyone could attend to us (there were 3 people manning the counter). It was 8.30 at night and not expected after a long day.   We had our dinner at 'Cafe Mercara Express'.The staff looked pre occupied with only 30% tables occupancy. Though staff was courteous, you had to look around repeatedly to get…"
The Park Chennai,A Good experience,4,"In my numerous trips to Chennai for business visits, The Park - Chennai has a special place. I have stayed in Park a couple of time and have felt at home. The 'experience' at Park is rewarding, both in terms of value for money and also for the kind of hospitality that is rewarded. The main disadvantage that Park has is its central location. I believe that it is centrally located to all the basic as well as luxurious amenities that one could offer. The markets are near, hotel staff is friendly, quick and takes care of all your needs.  Food is another thing that is one of the best things in Park. The breakfast buffet is a good collection of variety of cuisines from all across India. I really enjoyed the food there. Other things that are good in Park are the roof top Swimming Pool.…"

Hilton Chennai,Not the best of the Hiltons,4,The hotel commands a 2-3K premium over its contemporary Radisson which i dont think is justified. I did reserve this Hotel with the condition to do check-out at my requested timing which was later not accepted by the Staff there. i ordered in-room breakfast and was impressed with the generous quantity (taste was great too!). Lot of construction activities going around Hilton and doesn't offer a pleasant view to the residents.…
Taj Club House,Grandeur and Fun!!,4,A very nice property. It is centrally located. Very helpful staff. The lounge is extremely lively. We were lucky to have a live DJ playing some excellent discs. Breakfast is excellent. Ask the reception to get you a room which is not in the audio range of the lounge. The nights are loud here!…
The Park Chennai,Pleasant Tallywood experience,4,"My stay at PARK CHENNAI was great and was with my client. Located in downtown Chennai offers you great access to the main business districts like T-Nagar etc..The DECOR of the hotel is the highlight and it is very unique..thanks to the ""old"" studio GEMINI STUDIO site of the hotel. Although there are now no signs of ""film studio"" in the area, the theme of the hotel is around the ""cinema"". The tensile structures in lobby recollect the old-time screens, the seating in a row make it look like a cinema hall seating. What I liked is they put ""mogra"" - ""jasmine"" flowers in evening at lobby level .. you can carry a fistful of them with you even in your room.The rooftop restaurant, pool-side parasols are just so trendy..carpets welcome you in front of the elevators - they have a nice…"

Taj Club House,Excellent Business Hotel,4,"Its a great property in the heart of the city. Everything is very near and hence communication with any transport is very easy. We stayed here for 2 nights and all the staffs are very helpful and professional. The room which I stayed here was on the 5 floor and was of decent size, we would have preferred a little more private bath place (not translucent glass enclosure) as we were travelling with our toddler son. Hotel staff paid attention to details, they even sent a tray of chocolates for our son.  Being basically a business hotel, I would have appreciated free internet but it was a paid service. Buffet breakfast was of 5 star standards as you would expect. Swimming pool on 7th floor was clean and average size. I would make special note to the honest and diligent staffs in…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Super Luxury, but can improve",4,"For a super luxury Hotel which charges premium, there is a definite scope of improvement. On the first day the Mini Bar was not full. There is a scope of improvement of services at Breakfast table ( Madras Pavilion).   Went to Peshwari for a team lunch, the service was excellent, but the food not up to the standards of Bukhara or even Afghani ( ITC Windsor, Bangalore). The Laundry service was excellent,particularly Nalini from Fabricare.…"

The Park Chennai,Good Place to stay though not value for Money,4,I was here on a business trip. It has all the facilities expected from a 5-star hotel. The services are quite good. The location is decent enough. But its extremely pricey. We enquired for chauffeur services to Pondicherry and were shocked to see the prices which were almost 5 times the market rates. Food is good though pricey again. Overall a good place to stay though expensive…
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Poor Service,4,"Well I often stay here. I was there on 9th Oct and while sitting in restra I ordered some food for me and after 10 min the waiter came and asked - "" Sir my Chef has asked me to let you know  that this food will cost you Rs 1000 and with a big question marked on his face"" Most embracing moment for me.  Well then food was served and repeat order of Tandori Roti took around 17 minutes .  No one cares for the services.I was thinking today about this incident & now I can guess the reason for delay in service - Actually the restra was occupied by majority of foreigners and then being an Indian you never get attention. Sad to see that.  Next day there was a big goof-up while I was using the Iron Board in my room. Blue/Black colour of cloths used in Iron board got transferred / embossed…"

GreenPark Chennai,Expect no surprises..well oiled 4 star machinery,4,"It calls for a lot of effort for an organization to be continuously rated among the best 4 star hotels in chennai, inspite of the emergence of lot of other hospitality chains...and the Green Park is among my favorite destinations cos of that..   Pros: Ample Parking Close to Shopping Mall Spacious Rooms They have upgraded their washrooms with electronic bidet mechanism ...thats probably a first for this class of hotels probably anywhere in India! I stayed in 510 I think.. Breakfast with ample choice of food Good oriental,alternate restaurant and inexpensive bar!  Not the least - a very well trained and courteous staff  Cons: At the buffet breakfast  -there are not enough staff for sure... when I go there (have been there 3 times in last 2 months), there are none to be spotted…"

GreenPark Chennai,Neat and pretty - tad too busy,4,"Stayed there for a night,45 mins from airport, quick check in , staff were busy and tired , but i wouldn't complain. Rooms were spacious and clean. Breakfast buffet had a good selection of south indian and continental cuisine.  Didn't use the room service or the gym or spa as i was there just for a night, but I am likely to return if i am looking for a short stay.There is a shopping mall nearby for your shopping needs. Its more for business travellers I think.…"
Hilton Chennai,Exhilarating Experience,4,"We visited this place for Birthday function of young one in our family and were truly enthralled with the place. The infrastructure, decor, interior was well done and even the staff were courteous and friendly. The lounge and lobby have ample free space and offer nice seating. The grand chandeliers at lobby and staircase, makes it a great view to visitors. The party hall was apt for a small gathering and even the food served was sumptuous and tasty. It was pure vegetarian fare along with starters, full main course and desserts. Definitely, will visit this place next time to enjoy the fullest.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Good Luxury, bad housekeeping",4,Stayed there during an inhouse conference recently. Good rooms and hospitality but poor housekeeping. The used plates from in-room catering left out by the adjacent room guests weren't cleared from the corridors for almost 18hours. Room windows are littered by pigeon droppings. Asked for an extended checkout and was confirmed by the reservations but wasn't updated in my record. As a result the access card stopped functioning at their stipulated check out time and I was put to some inconvenience. Overall has scope for more imrpovement…
The Park Chennai,Modern comfort for the indulgent,4,"I stayed at The Park while on a visit to Chennai to attend a friend's wedding. The hotel has a very urban feel to it. The lobby and hall areas are done up in an elegantly modern fashion. The staff is very courteous and make you feel welcome. The room was quite spacious and was clean and smelt very nice. I particularly noticed that the flower vase on one of the side tables had real fresh lilies! We ordered some snacks in the room, and were promptly served. The star attraction of this hotel has to be the restaurant on the eighth floor called Aqua. We went there in the night and were blown away by the aura of this place. There is pool there and you can view the entire city nightlife from the top that makes a hell of a view! And the food here was top notch and offers an array of…"
Hilton Chennai,Stuck somewhere between Business and pleasure,4,"There are not too many negatives for this place.. Nice comfortable hotel, really polite and nice staff, take the breakfast.. one of the fantastic spreads for breakfast. Nice big LCD TV in the room.. Everything you can ask for.. What I think the hotel suffers is, the lack of clarity on whether it needs to position itself as a business hotel or purely as pleasure. From the location it is business, but the internet rates are obnoxious. You can get a stick for a month for the money you pay for a day. The gym is average though the trainers make some effort. The pool shuts by 7:30.. lacks a spa so it is not exactly a pleasure stay also.  One biggest negative is the water drain in the shower area. Poor design results in water accumulation when taking a shower... If you overlook it..…"

Special thank you to Hari – front of house manager,  Diwah – breakfast &  restaurant manager at Tulips,  Girija – her lovely welcoming smiles and Akhil & Tull  - both chefs, Kiran – front of house, Nasi – room service and many other that I don’t remember their names.  The restaurants were all great although mainly “Indian cuisine based” – for breakfast they do have beautiful fresh fruits and do great omelets and have cereals and salads and also provide for Japanese and Chinese guests.  The restaurant by the pool has amazing entrees and lots of…"

Taj Club House,Surprised by Taj !,4,"Since I am cabin crew, I stay at hotels practically 20 days a month, all over the world, and various hotel chains.  I was a hotelier prior to this, so reviewing hotels is deeply engrained in me.   I have stayed at various Taj properties, within India and internationally. Generally, I expect the rooms to be slightly old-fashioned and dated, when it comes to their properties across, if the property isn't a recent joiner into the group. So be it the rooms @ Taj Samudra in Colombo or Taj Vivanta in Trivandrum, they are pretty dated and look worn out.  However, since the Taj Club House is a relatively new property, the rooms are modern and fresh. Well maintained and well appointed. However, not very soundproof, I could hear the conversations from the aisles on my floor.  The wifi…"
The Park Chennai,A good stay,4,"Stayed in park as I was there for business trip. Hotel is located in prime location. Cost was reasonable for the service provided. The rating would be certainly for the staff, very well received and are very helpful. I found room a bit small for me but well maintained, but if u look closely u can see some gray areas which require some repairs. Don't expect any great views from the window, it is better to keep curtains down. Tried buffet it was ok like any star hotel no WOW factor in it. Ambience was good I liked the theme of old movies and there posters on every wall. Bathrooms are small as the room. Overall experience was good.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Live like a modern Chola,4,"Take time out when you visit this one. Possibly one of the most eagerly anticipated hotel openings in recent times in India, ITC’s Grand Chola has been in the making for the better part of the last decade. As it finally opens, I got some sneak previews of the hotel, and though it is far from complete, and only partially open, there are already glimmers of what lies ahead.    It is India’s largest hotel in floor area, and built to scale. Located in Guindy, on the way to the airport, it should be accessible to business travelers easily. It’s a massive structure, and the numbers just reinforce it.  It’s a 600-room hotel, spread over 1.5 million square feet in an eight acre plot. It has 100,000 square feet of banqueting and convention space which includes 30,000 square feet of…"

We were staying in the 2 bedroom Service Apartment  and though connected to the Hotel, was a bit f a walk to the reception area, but taking into account the huge property, this would have been from other areas also. The staff were courteous, but the check in took a lot of time. They need to increase the check in counters taking into account the no of rooms they have.4 check in counters are not sufficient.  overall a nice experience and one needs to stay here to experience the Hotel.  A must visit in my book.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Luxury Hotel,4,I have stayed a number of times in Chennai on Business trips but this was my first visit to the Grand Chola having watched it being constructed over the past few years. The hotel has been finished to a very high standard and contains a variety of top class restaurants. Ended up staying in one of the residency rooms which was nicely fiited out but too large for one person. Being a new hotel i found a number of things still to be opened and the staff not as helpfull as other places i have stayed at in Chennai. Also the Wireless Internet did not work very well in the room i stayed. Overall an enjoyable stay which hopefully will get even better over time.…

Hilton Chennai,Enchanting Marriage Reception of my daughter,4,"The location of the Hotel is on the main Road. However, its aesthetic look from outside is tarnished as Metro Rail project is on with their infrastructure. Any one who looks it from outside may not appreciate but once we step into the Hotel really awesome. Very sprawling lobby with comfortable sitting arrangements.  To get on to further floors you have sufficient number of Lifts and one elevator.  The reception hall is really good and it can accomadate around 500 pax at a time. For moving crowd, even more than 1000 pax can be easily arranged. In my case I had around 1300 pax for my daughters wedding reception. Besides this they also provided special VIP rooms.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Grand as the names suggests,4,"Recently stayed for a couple of nights on a business trip. Needless to say, this is one of the top hotels in the city. Absolute stunning interior with a lot of classy touch and decor. It literally feels inside a grand palace than anything else. The property is absolutely massive in size with about 5 entry points/porches as they call.  Room was also pretty nice and cozy. Liked the touch of modernization in the room in the form of the tablet control for everything including door open/shut. The bathroom was spacious and grand as well. Literally a page out of luxury.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Beautiful hotel ,4,"Stayed at this hotel recently for 3 weeks, in the executive room 2805. I was there for business and the service was top class throughout the hotel. Considering Chennai has lots of traffic and road noise I was expecting to hear cars beeping all night but the rooms are well soundproofed and I couldnt hear a thing. All staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and modern as they used ipads to control lighting, had a decent bathroom and were equipped with large enough tv's. Certain staff went above and beyond to make my stay confortable. Special mentions to Suboo and Susmita who always do an excellent job and provided tips on local sites and restaurants as well as greet you with a smile. Id also like to mention Udit who provides great service in the restaurants and…"
GreenPark Chennai,'Short but sweet'-wish it was longer!',4,"Late December 2011, we visited Chennai for a wedding, which was at the same hotel. So for convience, we stayed at Green Park. We were quite impressed with the whole experience. The rooms were spacious and  clean and the  service was very good. From the time we booked in to check out, it was handled professionally. Our stay was only for a day and I wished we had stayed longer. I would have no hesitation in staying there again.   I'm afraid I had no time to explore or experience much, where the food and other amenities were concerned. I have no doubt it would have met my expectations.…"

Special thank you to Hari – front of house manager,  Diwah – breakfast &  restaurant manager at Tulips,  Girija – her lovely welcoming smiles and Akhil & Tull  - both chefs, Kiran – front of house, Nasi – room service and many other that I don’t remember their names.  The restaurants were all great although mainly “Indian cuisine based” – for breakfast they do have beautiful fresh fruits and do great omelets and have cereals and salads and also provide for Japanese and Chinese guests.  The restaurant by the pool has amazing entrees and lots of…"
Taj Club House,Very reliable business hotel,4,"I stayed here for two nights and found it to be very good. Reception on arrival was warm and welcoming. The explantation of the hotel facilities was thorough. The hotel has a good choice of restaurants, which were of a very good standard. I particularly enjoyed my meal at Beyond Indus. The pool is a good size, if not a bit shallow and cold! The view from the rooftop is impressive and sets a good backdrop for dinner at the Mediterranean-themed rooftop restaurant. The gym, overlooking the pool is well equipped and well used. The spa is typical Taj Jiva fare, with reliably good service. The rooms are disappointing, but standard business-hotel stuff. They are relatively compact, with shower (no bath), good toiletries, comfortable bed, large tv, usual facilities (iron, safe, wifi…"

The hotel car entrance was not so grand and we were asked to take one full round of the property to reach their main grand entrance. As the hotel is still not ready in many ways ( not all the restaurants are open and they are yet to get the license to operate their bar), we were told that there was no reservation for the tables in the restaurant and it would be offered first- come first served basis. As we were there by 7:10 pm,  we were informed that they would open the restuarant only by 7:30 pm.   This hotel will stun you in the first look with such a…"

One can be excused for gawking. The lobby the rooms and the restaurants are amazing. The service is very good but short of impeccable. The food is great but I expected it to be better with its huge tag of luxury labelled every where. I did not stay there but I saw the rooms which was very nice. I like the technology used and IPOD for every room. The toilet in the rooms impressed me. It has many teething problems which the management must look into and I am sure it will be sorted out.I wish the coffee shop had huge windows so that a person could look outside.…

Taj Club House,Excellent Hotel for Business Trips,4,"I thought my stay would have been disastrous because the moment I checked in and walked to my room, I found my room in a mess and wasn't done up. The hotel made a mistake but was quick to rectify the situation. They immediately got me another room and were very apologetic about it.   I have to say that the service at the hotel was fantastic. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Comparing to the other Taj chain that I have been before, I have to say that Taj Club is much better in all aspects - cleanliness, comfort, and service. Though I have to note that its strange that the hotel leaves the doors to unoccupied rooms open. Its kind of creepy to be walking to your room and finding the doors leading to your room open! Maybe the management can look into this.  I had the…"

GreenPark Chennai,Exceptional Hospitality at Greenpark Hotels in South India,4,"I have been staying in Greenpark Chennai for the last few business visits, a little over a year. However I have experience of the same hotel in Hyderabad and Vizag as well. They are all exceptional in customer service. I remember a few years back I arrived at Greenpark Vizag with a bad cold with running nose, sore throat etc. The bell boy who was escorting me to the room, asked me politely, in good English whether I need any medicine? On my replying that I have already taken some, he said, ""Ok sir I shall send you warm water for drinking"". And it was there in my room within 5 minutes.I was moved. In my experience of so many 5 star hotels in and out of India I had never seen this kind of intelligent personal care. Chennai Greenpark is very good property, with a big spacious…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Hyatt Hospitality,4,"Short Stay, 2 nights for a business trip. Quite near to the hotel, approximately 40 mins to reach there. I had requested for a hotel pick up and I would suggest that the receiver of the guest would actually have the guest names on the signage. I ended up paying for pre paid cab & after the transaction a man with a Hyatt board came up. The hotel is entrance is already making an impression w/ a cool huge art hanging. The check in was pretty quick & we were upgraded to  room that was just oh so nice. Living room + a work place + a clean bathroom + a comfy looking bed ( pillow was not that great though). Breakfast was okay. Generally, the staff of the hotel is very helpful (specially the one in business center). The lobby area is very bright due to a cool rooftop they have, just…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","ITC Grand Chola: Great Expectations ; belied a little, but Overall a Great Hotel!",4,"April 3, 2014  to April 4, 2014	(one night)  Room No. 2803  So guys! For those who have read my earlier review on Hyatt Regency Chennai, I had said that the next time I will be in Chennai I would try the ITC Grand Chola. Seems the opportunity has come sooner than expected so here I am in Chennai, putting up for one night at the ITC Grand Chola.  At the outset, the rack rate given to us of Rs 8,900 per night (including breakfast), I think, was way too high. Finally, some negotiations by my dept. secy. yielded some results and I got a ‘corporate rate’ of Rs. 7,600 including breakfast; taxes over and above). This is still higher than the Rs. 6,500 for Hyatt Regency, but I can live with this rate.  The Hotel, per se, is massive, to say the least. The management also ensures that you…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Great Service but felt Cheated this time,4,"This was my third visit to the Hyatt Regency Chennai in December 2015. I had a 4 day business trip to Chennai, I had stayed for two nights at Hyatt and had to move to Raintree, St. Mary's due to unavailability of rooms at the Hyatt Regency. The floods struck on the 3rd day and I had further booked Hyatt again for the next three days and decided to wait till the airport was scheduled to open (the airport was shut down for 3 days). The surprise comes here when the hotel allowed to book the rooms whereas the there was no way to enter the hotel as the entrance to the hotel was blocked due to water. I had booked the rooms through make my trip and paid for the 3 days in advance. Somehow managed to get out of chennai as the rooms in the other hotels were not available and when…"

Rooms: Very good spacious rooms with a great comfortable bed, 32 inch TV, work desk, mini fridge, spacious wardrobe with safe (locker), etc.  Food: Complementary buffet breakfast was very good and enormous with plenty of options - continental (sausages, eggs - the way you want it, baked beans, toast, varieties of bread, pastries), south/north Indian (idly, varieties of dosas, parathas, pooris, vada ...), juices, fruits, desserts etc. I did not sample the lunch and dinner buffet, but going by the…"
The Park Chennai,Good But Can Be Better,4,"I stayed in park last month while appearing for my visa interview. Though overall the hotel looks good but due to the fact it is converted to hotel from some other place it still contains some loose ends. Room walls and bathrooms rooms are not so properly finished even the overall size of the bathroom looks a little bit smaller.  Food wise breakfast was quite good and again the drinks area was too small.  Room service was again a little bit disappointing since i have to remind them twice before they turn in with my oder.  Check in and checkout both took quite a time with only two person managing that , i definitely believe if they can have two more people it would make things move quicker.  Location wise its excellent if you came for USA visa interview since the US embassy is…"

We had dinner at 601 and ordered Indian..tho the service is pretty slow.. however as it was a pleasure trip we had all the time... and the food was very good so we didn't mind the wait. Also,we had to keep asking the waiter to replenish water every time as they kept walking past us without noticing our empty glasses.   The decor is pretty cool..The approach is grand, the interiors all done up in shades of brown and cream  One thing that we really liked was Aqua..the terrace restaurant.. it is an open sky pool place and has comfortable bed kinda seating..must visit if you are travelling as a couple.

The check in was smooth with professionals handling the space. The lift to the room is a little small and cannot accommodate more than 3 - 4 people. No expected of a hotel which can be rated a 3 to 4 star. Although I had requested for a king sized bed, I was given two small queen sized beds. Although there was a swimming pool, it was not functional. The home service was good and the food served though expensive was very tasty. The complimentary breakfast was good and met our expectations. I was also invited by the customer service about special mexican food festival. I did join for the mexican food festival but there was a private party running by the side of the restaurant and dampened the…"
The Park Chennai,"Very convenient, but definitely needs some improvements",4,"Finished my visa interview today and stayed at the Park for that. The park is very convenient in terms of location for the visa process and all the staff at the hotel know everything about the process. For instance, the security guards helped me find an auto to the bio-metric center. And it is obviously just 2 road crossings away from the consulate. And I was happy that they accommodated a check-in one hour earlier than the usual 2 pm time since I could manage only a 9 am flight into Chennai. All in all a comfortable stay. All the staff were extremely warm, especially a lady in-charge on my floor (I forgot to note her name) who came to inquire about my comfort on two occasions and the duty manager Mr. Narasimhan who got my room changed because the first one had some knocking…"

As soon as I walked in, the staff made me feel extremely welcome and have me the 5 star service. I stay in a lot of hotels in the uk, including hiltons, and I have to say, the uk staff should take note! Some ppl on here have commented about a damp smell: I too noticed it, although to be fair it's been 40c and extremely humid. Couple that with excellent air con and there's bound to be something that meets in the middle. Didn't bother me at all.  The q bar on the terrace was a great place to relax after a busy day, and their food was impeccable.   My honest feedback is that I didn't expect tho to be paying London prices for food. …"

Taj Club House,Contemporary Club House,4,This Taj property located in the heart of the city is equipped with the paraphernalia to cater to the requirements of business travelers. The Superior room is on the smaller side and one could compare it to the size of hotel rooms in Hong Kong. The glass casing that surrounds the bathroom compromises on your privacy if you are sharing the room with a work colleague or a friend. This is surprising considering the USP of the hotel is to target the business traveler. A proper mist glass would be better than whats in place currently. Service (House Keeping & Room Service) as one would expect from Taj Group is top notch. The maximum volume in the television has been set at 18 to avoid noise pollution and disturbance to others. The pool located on the roof top (7th floor) is clean and…

However, we had some lovely assistance from the housekeeping and in room dining team especially when it came to baby food. The chefs understood the anxiety of a mom travelling with a baby and created some nutritious dal bhaat/khichadi/porridge recipes for our baby.  thanks to MAdras Pavilion and CHef Nikhil and Chef Padma.

Room is rather small, especially feels so given the emphasis on size and grandeur in rest of the hotel. Room is very high-tech with an iPad to control most things. I ordered room service through the iPad while I was on a conference call - so was a good use-case! The other effect  found useful was automatic volume adjustment on TV when there was a call on the phone. Big difference vis a vis the low-ech Trident where I normally stay in Chennai.  The restaurants were good (not exceptional) - had lunch at Cafe Madras with a group and dinner at another one with a friend. Wouldn't go there if not staying at the hotel.

Taj Club House,Exceeded Expectations!,4,"As a resident of Chennai I had not stayed here earlier but had the opportunity last week when I had to stay over for an official meeting. have been to the excellent coffee shop several times earlier and to the Indian restaurant which are both excellent but the rooms were really a big surprise. Being the least known among the Taj properties in Chennai, it was great to see that the rooms and service are right up there with the other Taj Hotels in the city! Food at the buffets, set up for our group were also excellent with the sea food in particular of a very high quality.

GreenPark Chennai,Stayed with my family for 2 weeks - fantastic experience,4,"We paid a visit to India in mid October - myself, my wife, our two young children and my parents.  Since our relatives didn't have enough space for all of us, we elected to stay at the Green Park.  We stayed at the hotel for nearly two weeks and were treated wonderfully.  The hotel itself is quite nice, maybe not palatial but quite good.  Our big accolade, though, has to be for the staff - we got to know them quite well, and they were always accommodating, even with sudden / unusual requests, especially when it came to what we needed for the kids.  Never without a smile, everyone always said hello, and it's worth saying that my kids got candies and balloons every single day from the front desk (is that a good thing?)!! The buffet was fine, and the formal dining restaurant was…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,A perfect transit hotel in Chennai!,4,"While coming back from an international trip my family had to take a night break in Chennai onwards to Bangalore. This turned out to be a perfect transit hotel, very well situated right next to the airport. The staff in this hotel are very helpful and go out of the way to help you. The drivers who came to pick and drop us at the airport were also very courteous. The room we stayed was nice and spacious, and the highlight definitely was the massage chair in the room, perfect after a long flight. The price is reasonable, but the taxes in Chennai are very high making the whole deal quite overpriced.…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",One of the decent hotels ever stayed!!,4,"Recently I flew down all the way from San Fransico to Chennai for a short vacation when I got a chance to stay in this hotel for the initial 2 days,   All I can say about the hotel was clean and neat, Pretty much OKAY among 4 start hotel categories.  It's actually a value for money if you book it through some deals.  Certainly, there is some room for improvement in the amenities provided. For instance, I had some wi-fi issues which got sorted out later in the morning.   Despite that, I liked their hospitality service very much. All the staffs working in this hotel were really sincere about their job duties and supportive enough.

GreenPark Chennai,The table by the Pool fantasy and the best chef this side of the town!,4,"Me and my wife, just like that decided to go out for dinner and were searching for barbecue joints in the city, then by chance came across a BBQ joint in GreenPark which is  super close to where i live.  First, the weather in chennai was awesome that night and the romance of sitting by the pool was enticing enough to us to give it a try. So we did!  The menu was like ok ok and not too inviting enough, but the starters brought in by the CHEF Sujith was nice to linger around more. The chef was interested enough on his guests to constantly make rounds to all tables and it was nice to see him interacting with guests, this has become a rarity in restaurants nowadays.  He made sure we were served all the starters and refills again to make us high on them alone, so we almost skipped…"

Taj Club House,Very Pleasant Stay for a Travelling Celiac!,4,"I am a diagnosed celiac (must have gluten free food) Was in Chennai on business for 3 days and was resigning myself to my default food when travelling: steak and vegetables. Which is great but gets bit monotonous after few days! I seldom try anyother food as I need to be 100% sure the kitchen understand that I cannot have any gluten at all.  Thus I ate steak and lamb from their main restaurant on first night and it was average. The next night I ventured into their Indian restaurant: Beyond Indus and told the head waiter about my celiac. He had the chef Nisi come around to discuss and I was blown away how understanding and helpful he was. Nisi cooking was delicious, fresh and gluten free! Would recommend this hotel for their BeyondIndus restaurant alone!…"

There were initial hiccups with the airport transfer which we had booked along with making the reservation but for some unknown reason inspite of reminders they couldnt find the booking for the airport pick up and this was a big mess when I checked into the hotel. But the duty manger Mr. Seni was very receptive to feedback and left no stone unturned in making the rest of the stay comfortable and all issues taken care of.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Live like a modern Chola,4,"Take time out when you visit this one. Possibly one of the most eagerly anticipated hotel openings in recent times in India, ITC’s Grand Chola has been in the making for the better part of the last decade. As it finally opens, I got some sneak previews of the hotel, and though it is far from complete, and only partially open, there are already glimmers of what lies ahead.    It is India’s largest hotel in floor area, and built to scale. Located in Guindy, on the way to the airport, it should be accessible to business travelers easily. It’s a massive structure, and the numbers just reinforce it.  It’s a 600-room hotel, spread over 1.5 million square feet in an eight acre plot. It has 100,000 square feet of banqueting and convention space which includes 30,000 square feet of…"

The house keeping service was very good and the girl who cleaned our room (Rathi) always put a smile on our face with small gestures like decorate the floor with petals of roses in the shape of a heart really captured my heart.  The laundry service was good and fast eventhough sometime i did wonder did they really wash the clothes because of the mark of my lipstick on one of the t-shirt being there despite of 3 or 4 washes. Also there was a small problem with the laundry bill while checking out which they sorted out after bringing to their attention.

He recognized me from my previous trip! I'll be flying out again in a few days and look forward to seeing him again.   Also, G.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Luxury with noise,4,"Great hotel, staff, food and room. No complaints. Makes you feel like a king. However, the room allocated to me was probably near the take off and landing for the Chennai airport and also near the Guindy railway station. It may have been that the room was having poor sound proofing and the take off, landing and the train whistle was very loud and heard inside the room.   The hotel itself is like a palace and from your room to the breakfast at Madras Pavilion (stayed in the North Wing towers) was quite a walk and also the sheer luxury exuded due to extensive use of marble all around.…"

The Park Chennai,Easy access for business travellers,4,"This hotel offers great value for money however it also has it's drawbacks.  Both Security and service are lax - which is an issue, the bar and outdoor pool area adjacent to the 8th floor accommodation wing does not make it particularly pleasant or easy to negotiate to your room in the ate evening when returning from business meetings.  We also found it odd that a hotel of this standard would have only one bread toaster available in the whole hotel.  This was working the first day we went to breakfast however on the second and third days we were there - there was no toaster and the staff told us that they only had one - and it was broken.  On the plus side, the staff are very helpful, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, the beds are comfortable and the internet is good, the…"

I used the Cafe Mercara express and the Madras Pavillon . If you are a true epicurean you will like the choice given to you in this hotel.  -My room as modern, clean and fitted with amenities that you expect of a 5 stars place. The big plus and fun thing to use is the Ipad in your room which allows you to control many facilities including the camera outside your door, you can also open your door with the Ipad. You are provided with infos about the hotel and things to do outside (areas to visit and a little of history). the Ipad is a very nice tool! -The gym and the pool areas are great for a good workout and some time to relax. -The staff everywherearound the premises  were friendly and professional and again it…"

Only down side is it is in the middle of nowhere you have to get a Taxi to go anywhere. While in town take a cab to the beach, and wander around the side streets there for an authentic taste of India. Don't be afraid to try one of the restaurants also - many look like bare halls but they will server you a variety of curries served on a banana leaf, delicious dosas and other tasty morsels and you will struggle to pay more than $5 for a feast. Get used to eating with your hands - no utensils provided ! You will be astonished at the prices as well - my rate was under $100 per night with Breakfast…"

I liked the modern & abstracts hung on the wall, giving the overall property a trendy look.  At many places you will find funny quotes and articles.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Incredible place, but almost too incredible for it's own good",4,"This is a fabulous place, there is no doubt about it, one can see that there was no expense spared in the building. I was in a towers room for business, and the room was very well sized with a large connected bathroom area. Room cleanliness was less than I had expected - lots of greasy dust around the air conditioning intakes and a number of the power sockets were pulling away from the walls. The view from the room is of the newly completed (but as yet unfinished) Chennai Metro and a very busy road.  The windows are excellently insulated however, and none of the incredible road noise enters the room.  Blackout curtains ensure a decent night's sleep.  The staff are very obliging, but there are almost too many of them, meals were interrupted by waiter after waiter asking how the…"

The pool and gym meet an average standard.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Massive Structure ........Excels in most departments!!!!,4,"Huge hotel and its easier said than done to maintain such a massive structure and though there is always room for improvement, I am not being critical here as ITC is doing a commendable job.  Everybody has their own tastes and likings And for me I like grand atrium type lobbies,but here the center stage is given to a grand staircase and the seating and reception counter doesn't seem to match the scale of the hotel, although there are plenty of seating scattered at different levels of the hotel but I missed a normal large lobby with plenty of seating [its purely a choice and by no means a negative point here] Check in experience was so so and I would like to forget it. It certainly didn't match the ITC luxury collection level.Check out was ok. I stayed in the towers room which…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Good but with blemishes,4,"Well, in general pretty good but too far from perfection to be considered ""luxury"". I had a ""luxury room"" and this was pretty small like in any 3 star hotel or even smaller. What is really good is the gym which is double the size you usually get and very well equipped.  They try to do everything right and invest a lot in guest satisfaction but are not always successful: - There are plenty of waiters during breakfast but they sometimes just ignore you and you really have to hunt them to get coffee refills. - The bar closes at 11 and the music is sometimes so loud you can't understand a single word. - You can't take your drinks outside to the lobby because it is forbidden. - Housekeeping often forgets something: sometimes there is no water, sometimes there are no fruits... - The…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Sheer Opulence ,work in progress",4,"Had a chance to stay at this property in march 2013 , must say , its VERY big . The room size and the bathroom size are one of the biggest I have seen in all my travels till date. the room is very modern ,IPAD control is one nifty feature to control almost everything in room . free WiFi is one other feature which was very welcome (i think its complementary for a short period as the property is failry new) .  had dinner at the In- house restaurents - The Madras Pavilion & Cafe Mercara Express ,excellent personalised service ,which you can always expect at an ITC property. More restaurents are still coming up , so will have to wait till they are operational.  had foreign guests travelling with me , so the buffet choice at The Madras Pavilion was a little too South-Indian for my…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",A very well appointed hotel in the centre of Chennai,4,We were very well received by staff on arrival at the hotel after a long-haul flight – even at 0500 hours in the morning. One of the Reception Desk staff members (Shalom) very kindly showed us around the hotel and explained the various restaurants and facilities. The room (one if the ITC Chola rooms) was well appointed and we settled in comfortably for a short sleep before the day started. We started our day with a visit to the Madras Pavilion for a buffet lunch and found this to have a wide range on Indian and International foods. Waiting staff were very attentive – perhaps too much so and we felt at times that we were being watched whilst eating. We had breakfast the next morning at the same venue and found it to be somewhat hectic with large numbers of guests all vying for…
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Truly Grand,4,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 week on a mix of business and pleasure.  Many hotels state they are grand, but this hotel truly lives up to its name. It's huge, with a mix of long term residence, business men/women and a scattering of vacationers.  The hotel is located about 15min from Chennai International Airport by a hotel arranged car, and the transfer was smooth.   Being SPG Platinum I was upgraded to a larger Towers Room, which was ample in size with a well thought out layout. The room was clean, shower hot, internet fast and king bed very comfortable. All room functions are controlled by a house ipad, which is very responsive and a great novelty. The hotel has only been open a couple of years, and as such not all it's entertainment and shopping facilities are up and running…"

The Park Chennai,Good But Can Be Better,4,"I stayed in park last month while appearing for my visa interview. Though overall the hotel looks good but due to the fact it is converted to hotel from some other place it still contains some loose ends. Room walls and bathrooms rooms are not so properly finished even the overall size of the bathroom looks a little bit smaller.  Food wise breakfast was quite good and again the drinks area was too small.  Room service was again a little bit disappointing since i have to remind them twice before they turn in with my oder.  Check in and checkout both took quite a time with only two person managing that , i definitely believe if they can have two more people it would make things move quicker.  Location wise its excellent if you came for USA visa interview since the US embassy is…"
GreenPark Chennai,Nice Hotel,4,"Nice huge hotel, beautifully done. I stayed for 2 nights and was very happy. The location is next to a mall and few other hotels and restaurants including Vasanta Bhavan.   Rooms were of good size. The TV was quite small - that was the only let down.I had a room on the 5th floor which had swimming pool view.   The bar is large and with good service but was quite uninteresting. The ambience is not consistent with the rest of the hotel. It neither had any music nor comfortable seating. There were people in large groups (probably sales folks or small businessmen) who were drinking and having loud conversations. They provided excellent and abundant munchies.   Please note that the prices on food and liquor menus are without taxes (which these days amount to a large number). On room…"
The Park Chennai,Good Hotel,4,"I stayed first time in Park last week. Its looks old, but service are good.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Superb service,4,"I would largely agree with the points that most other reviewers have made here.  This is a huge and impressive property on first inspection - closer inspection does reveal some issues (largely due to the quality of the workmanship during construction - small defects here and there, but if those kind of issues are likely to bother you greatly, then the rest of India is probably going to raise your blood pressure excessively.)  I still found the Grand Chola an oasis of calm from the frenzy outside the main gates, and the food was just excellent (I'd recommend a meal at the restaurant Peshawri - I was lucky enough to dine with some locals who had known the chef and key personnel there for many years, and the dishes they recommended were just fantastic).  But the main thing that I…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",A Great One Night Experience In Chennai,4,"I recently had the opportunity to stay in 3 different locations across India, and I wanted to provide some insight into not only the hotels, but some travel tips as well.  First some travel Tips.  My Flight was from the US through London Heathrow, onto Chennai.  The trip is long, so get ready for that.  From KC, it was about 9 hours total to London, Layover, and another 9 hours to Chennai.  My Arrival was in the early morning, and the airport was already hustling with people, I had a driver meet me at the airport which made travel to the airport painless.  If you are not traveling on business, you will need to arrange travel, Uber does exist, but there were plenty of Taxis and transportation options available.  I would guess it would take about 15-20 US dollars to get to hotels.…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Nice experience at Radisson GRT,4,"Great experience, good service and staff, best Radisson experience so far. F&B slightly expensive compared to Chennai standards.

The Park Chennai,Good location and a very good hotel,4,"Room: Fantastic rooms, large, well provided for all amenities, with large balconies overlooking the prime location of Chennai Bath: Spacious again, clean, bath tub that would fit in 2, nice aromatic toiletries Service: Though did not avail much of room service but it was very prompt Food: It was the best part. The buffet they served for breakfast was exhaustive ranging from continental cuisine, north indian to south indian. And it was delicious!  A very good hotel but lacks in its maintenance. Its an old property but it should be maintained as one of the lifts got stuck and emergency call had to be made...  Need to mention about the pool as well. Located on the top floor, one gets a wonderful view of the city. They have very nice sit outs where one can enjoy a beer while taking…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Pretty Good But Not Special,4,"Stayed here for 2 nights. First impressions were good, once I was able to negotiate the ground floor and get up to the atrium lobby.   The room was large with the rather interesting central wash basin unit and mirror. Large enough though perhaps more could be done with the space. My shower had an uneven floor resulting a cold puddle being left at times.   Gym was great, bright and airy with a decent range of equipment.   Breakfast / coffee shop was the highlight for me, both for the room and range of food.   Tried the Italian restaurant for a quick dinner. It wasn't cheap but the quality was very good.   Service - as you'd expect from Hyatt, fast and efficient.   Overall, enjoyable stay, but having stayed at the Leela recently for the same length of time, not quite at the same…"

The room was big and clean.Has a good bed , a tv with all major channels subscribed , The hotel has a pool, gym and spa and has 3 restaurants ,1 bar and a pub/nightclub in its premises. A mall is located right opposite the hotel. The only thing that can be improved is the bfast buffet which provides many options but needs some improvement on the Indian options.Rooms are provided with complimentary fruit platters on demand and a few items kept in the mini bar like soft drinks , pack of chips , biscuits are complimentary too. All in all a decent stay with close access to Srvana Bhavan , Buhari , dindigal thalpakatti and a major temple…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,"Good location, good service",4,Location is excellent if you are catching an early morning flight. The service is very prompt and helpful.

The Park Chennai,Pleasant Tallywood experience,4,"My stay at PARK CHENNAI was great and was with my client. Located in downtown Chennai offers you great access to the main business districts like T-Nagar etc..The DECOR of the hotel is the highlight and it is very unique..thanks to the ""old"" studio GEMINI STUDIO site of the hotel. Although there are now no signs of ""film studio"" in the area, the theme of the hotel is around the ""cinema"". The tensile structures in lobby recollect the old-time screens, the seating in a row make it look like a cinema hall seating. What I liked is they put ""mogra"" - ""jasmine"" flowers in evening at lobby level .. you can carry a fistful of them with you even in your room.The rooftop restaurant, pool-side parasols are just so trendy..carpets welcome you in front of the elevators - they have a nice…"

"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",It's an ideal business hotel,4,"I visit Chennai, for work, once every 45 days and stay for 7-10 days.   Lemon Tree Chennai has now become a home-away-from-home while I am in Chennai. The Executive Rooms are pretty spacious. There are plenty of food options and the breakfast and dinner buffets are very good for a visitor from any part of the world. The staff is friendly and cooperative.   It has a small swimming pool, a 24-hour cafe and a separate bar-lounge.   Taking a cab from the hotel might be a little expensive, but that's expected of a business hotel.   The Assistant Manager - FrontDesk and his team often go an extra mile to give you comfort.   Overall, a perfect place to stay while you're traveling for work.…"
Taj Club House,Excellent Hotel for Business Trips,4,"I thought my stay would have been disastrous because the moment I checked in and walked to my room, I found my room in a mess and wasn't done up. The hotel made a mistake but was quick to rectify the situation. They immediately got me another room and were very apologetic about it.   I have to say that the service at the hotel was fantastic. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Comparing to the other Taj chain that I have been before, I have to say that Taj Club is much better in all aspects - cleanliness, comfort, and service. Though I have to note that its strange that the hotel leaves the doors to unoccupied rooms open. Its kind of creepy to be walking to your room and finding the doors leading to your room open! Maybe the management can look into this.  I had the…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Fantastic comfortable stay with friendly service,4,"Large hotel with 600+ rooms. Clean hotel room and luxurious with marble bathroom finishes. There was always plenty of bottled water (free) stocked in the room which was great to take out and about. There was lots of dining choices such as asian, indian and italian. It ranged from casual to fine dining. I had dinner at the Italian and the seafood pasta dish was nice - although it was a little pricy. The buffet breakfast was AMAZING! I thoroughly enjoyed this every morning with so much variety and choice from Indian to hot breakfast to pastries and cereals. This really catered for everyone and I filled up well with the delicious assortments of of sweets - The french toast was awesome and the custard donuts (I have a sweet tooth!). One place to visit is Nutmeg - This is a groumet…"

GreenPark Chennai,Exceptional Hospitality at Greenpark Hotels in South India,4,"I have been staying in Greenpark Chennai for the last few business visits, a little over a year. However I have experience of the same hotel in Hyderabad and Vizag as well. They are all exceptional in customer service. I remember a few years back I arrived at Greenpark Vizag with a bad cold with running nose, sore throat etc. The bell boy who was escorting me to the room, asked me politely, in good English whether I need any medicine? On my replying that I have already taken some, he said, ""Ok sir I shall send you warm water for drinking"". And it was there in my room within 5 minutes.I was moved. In my experience of so many 5 star hotels in and out of India I had never seen this kind of intelligent personal care. Chennai Greenpark is very good property, with a big spacious…"

But during my 24 hour stay, I went twice out and put room clean sign but both times I didn't get my rooms clean. Anyways, that not too much of negligance, I guess they keep missing my timings.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Great stay! The price reflects the service you get!,4,"It's been almost a year since I stayed here, but I've got a good memory so here goes my review.  This hotel is pricey, even by Western standards, but the service is top notch. The majority of the staff is extremely welcoming and friendly, and I'd be remiss to not give a shout out to Andrew, who was so warm to us during our stay. Every morning we were greeted in a sincere manner while enjoying our breakfast buffet (which was delicious as far as hotel breakfasts go).  The building is a bit dated and it definitely shows when you enter your hotel room. If you're in need of a driver, the hotel can provide one and while the cost is high, the service is excellent. The hotel's proximity to the airport and the fact that its restaurant The Kabab Factory is absolutely delicious made it a…"

Except for check-in process (in spite of my request for a non-smoking room was allocated a smoking room, and had to request for a change because of the smell; wasted time moving to the new room) rest of the stay was a breeze and very pleasant.  Rooms: Very good spacious rooms with a great comfortable bed, 32 inch TV, work desk, mini fridge, spacious wardrobe with safe (locker), etc.  Food: Complementary buffet breakfast was very good and enormous with plenty of options - continental (sausages, eggs - the way you want it, baked beans, toast, varieties of bread, pastries), south/north Indian (idly, varieties of dosas, parathas, pooris, vada ...), juices, fruits, desserts etc. I did not sample the lunch and dinner buffet, but going by the…"
Hilton Chennai,Within easy reach of most destinations,4,"On first glance this is a lovely hotel. Roof top pool is nice and relaxing, being able to watch the traffic on the busy roads and trains on the metro lines. A steady stream of horn blowing I found quite amusing as they all sounded different. The Vintage Bank has a happy hour from 5.30 - 9.00pm, be warned use mosquito repellent before you venture down there. Staff are lovely and very helpful. Sid in the executive lounge was a rare find, so knowledgeable and pleasant with it. This lounge was great as no mosquitos;-)  Happy hour 6.30pm till 8.30pm with great snacks too. One thing that did let the hotel down was on two separate evenings we were awoken at 3am by maintenance work in the room above ours, Hammering and drilling. We complained on both evenings that this was unacceptable…"

Food is good though pricey again. Overall a good place to stay though expensive…
GreenPark Chennai,Gem of a hotel in Chennai,4,"We were in Chennai for four days for a friend's wedding and stayed at Green Park for three nights as it was the closest hotel to the venue (very centrally located in the middle of a busy area but built sufficiently off the main street so that there is no noise pollution once you enter the hotel premises).   Not only was the hotel very reasonable, but also we were well taken care of and our stay was a pleasant one. The buffet breakfast (included in the room rate) was a sumptuous spread of Indian and continental cuisine apart from a heady variety of juices, salads and preserves, etc. We ate at one of the hotel's restaurants (Once upon a time) for just one meal (as we were out for the most part of the day) and enjoyed the food. The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and clean. Other…"

The rating would be certainly for the staff, very well received and are very helpful. I found room a bit small for me but well maintained, but if u look closely u can see some gray areas which require some repairs. Don't expect any great views from the window, it is better to keep curtains down. Tried buffet it was ok like any star hotel no WOW factor in it. Ambience was good I liked the theme of old movies and there posters on every wall. Bathrooms are small as the room. Overall experience was good.…"

Priyanka at the travel desk was always there to sort out our taxis to and from the office ensuring they were on time and where possible the same driver each day. She was extremely friendly and able to sort out any issues professionally and promptly as well as helping us organise our weekend tours ensuring the driver was made aware of the places we wanted to visit. Jai at the coffee shop greeted us each morning and ensured my colleagues and I had our drinks ready without even having to ordering. Jai surely does make the best hot drinks in Chennai. He assisted us with meals ensuring we had…"

The Park Chennai,Easy access for business travellers,4,"This hotel offers great value for money however it also has it's drawbacks.  Both Security and service are lax - which is an issue, the bar and outdoor pool area adjacent to the 8th floor accommodation wing does not make it particularly pleasant or easy to negotiate to your room in the ate evening when returning from business meetings.  We also found it odd that a hotel of this standard would have only one bread toaster available in the whole hotel.  This was working the first day we went to breakfast however on the second and third days we were there - there was no toaster and the staff told us that they only had one - and it was broken.  On the plus side, the staff are very helpful, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, the beds are comfortable and the internet is good, the…"

Hilton Chennai,Good stay in an international style hotel ,4,Nice stay in this hotel mid December .

The styling of the whole room is modern but without any specific touch of India . The restaurant is offering a wide diversity of food from Indian to other origins.  The gym is to my point of view not that large and quickly booked when 4 or 5 people are in .  I did not had time to enjoy the roof top pool .... probably next time . …

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Poor Service,4,"Well I often stay here. I was there on 9th Oct and while sitting in restra I ordered some food for me and after 10 min the waiter came and asked - "" Sir my Chef has asked me to let you know  that this food will cost you Rs 1000 and with a big question marked on his face"" Most embracing moment for me.  Well then food was served and repeat order of Tandori Roti took around 17 minutes .  No one cares for the services.I was thinking today about this incident & now I can guess the reason for delay in service - Actually the restra was occupied by majority of foreigners and then being an Indian you never get attention. Sad to see that.  Next day there was a big goof-up while I was using the Iron Board in my room. Blue/Black colour of cloths used in Iron board got transferred / embossed…"

The Park Chennai,Modern comfort for the indulgent,4,"I stayed at The Park while on a visit to Chennai to attend a friend's wedding. The hotel has a very urban feel to it. The lobby and hall areas are done up in an elegantly modern fashion. The staff is very courteous and make you feel welcome. The room was quite spacious and was clean and smelt very nice. I particularly noticed that the flower vase on one of the side tables had real fresh lilies! We ordered some snacks in the room, and were promptly served. The star attraction of this hotel has to be the restaurant on the eighth floor called Aqua. We went there in the night and were blown away by the aura of this place. There is pool there and you can view the entire city nightlife from the top that makes a hell of a view! And the food here was top notch and offers an array of…"

The Park Chennai,"Great Hotel, with 2 big reservations",4,"I just returned from three nights at the Park Chennai and had a mostly positive experience there. The rooms are slick and intelligently designed. Very clean but the signs of wear are beginning to show for the most discerning of eyes. The cheeky touches (Bollywood posters,  cartoons in the lift) add a bit of levity to staying in Bangalore, which can be hard work.   There are two problems with this hotel which might put off western travellers. One is security. When you enter the hotel you go through a metal detector, your body is scanned with a wand, and your bag is inspected. It's rather quick and rather perfunctory, but still a pain. I've encountered this at Taj hotels (obviously), but I am not sure why they do this.   The second issue is the hotel's bar. The Park has a very…"

Taj Club House,Great service and hotel.  Some minor issues,4,"Overall, this hotel is fantastic.  Great service, and good facilities make this a winner.  This is a new hotel, and none of the cab or rickshaw drivers had heard of this hotel.  So it took us a while to find the location.  The service is great, and everyone is really helpful.  I would especially recommend the pool staff, as they brought out cold water bottles for everyone at the pool regularly.  They also had a cart with games, books and other miscellaneous stuff on it for entertainment.    The restaurants are decent, not great.  Only Kefi, the Mediterranean restaurant was excellent.  The Indian restaurant was a hit and miss, and the buffet is very standard.   I did like the service at the Indian restaurant though, and they were very helpful is assisting us and customizing the…"
The Park Chennai,A good business hotel,4,"Have stayed in The Park twice on my official trips and kind of like the hotel. The lobby is nice and big giving you a feeling like you are in a really big place, which is not entirely true but that's a nice play.   I like the posters of old flicks in the lobbies and rooms though the posters in the room should have been better chosen. The room I stayed in had a hand drawn poster of a horror movie and that's kind of pissing off when you get up in the morning.   The breakfast is fantastic and you need to really hold yourself back if you have meetings lined up. They have lovely South Indian fare and live counters. Really really nice breakfast.   The highlight is of course the swimming pool at the terrace. It doubles up as a great outdoor lounge at night and it is great fun to laze…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",A Great One Night Experience In Chennai,4,"I recently had the opportunity to stay in 3 different locations across India, and I wanted to provide some insight into not only the hotels, but some travel tips as well.  First some travel Tips.  My Flight was from the US through London Heathrow, onto Chennai.  The trip is long, so get ready for that.  From KC, it was about 9 hours total to London, Layover, and another 9 hours to Chennai.  My Arrival was in the early morning, and the airport was already hustling with people, I had a driver meet me at the airport which made travel to the airport painless.  If you are not traveling on business, you will need to arrange travel, Uber does exist, but there were plenty of Taxis and transportation options available.  I would guess it would take about 15-20 US dollars to get to hotels.…"

Each room has an iPad which controls lights, TV and even can open the front door of your room, while you sit in bed, after you see who it is on the iPad screen! Enables you to have a great breakfast in bed!  The quality of the food and the service at the Peshawari, the gourmet Frontier Province Restaurant are absolutely super! As good as the very best!

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent hotel with some minor issues,4,"Breakfast needs to be organized in a better way. The delay in seating created a long queue which I have never faced in a 5* hotel earlier. Moreover, the given seating was assigned to a different person when we took our food and came back!!! I asked to prepare poori bhaji and it took good 30 minutes and 4 follow-ups to get it. A couple in the table beside my table was complaining about a used glass on the table!! In my case, there was no glass to drink water!! You see this kind of mess in a 3* hotel. You don't expect them in a 5* hotel. The preprogrammed IPad is an excellent idea, however, it lacks practicality in many cases. For example, goodnight mode turned off everything except the light above your bed. Imagine! I had to play around with it about for 10 minutes to find a…"
Taj Club House,Contemporary Club House,4,This Taj property located in the heart of the city is equipped with the paraphernalia to cater to the requirements of business travelers. The Superior room is on the smaller side and one could compare it to the size of hotel rooms in Hong Kong. The glass casing that surrounds the bathroom compromises on your privacy if you are sharing the room with a work colleague or a friend. This is surprising considering the USP of the hotel is to target the business traveler. A proper mist glass would be better than whats in place currently. Service (House Keeping & Room Service) as one would expect from Taj Group is top notch. The maximum volume in the television has been set at 18 to avoid noise pollution and disturbance to others. The pool located on the roof top (7th floor) is clean and…
GreenPark Chennai,Stayed with my family for 2 weeks - fantastic experience,4,"We paid a visit to India in mid October - myself, my wife, our two young children and my parents.  Since our relatives didn't have enough space for all of us, we elected to stay at the Green Park.  We stayed at the hotel for nearly two weeks and were treated wonderfully.  The hotel itself is quite nice, maybe not palatial but quite good.  Our big accolade, though, has to be for the staff - we got to know them quite well, and they were always accommodating, even with sudden / unusual requests, especially when it came to what we needed for the kids.  Never without a smile, everyone always said hello, and it's worth saying that my kids got candies and balloons every single day from the front desk (is that a good thing?)!! The buffet was fine, and the formal dining restaurant was…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nice but over-hyped,4,"Beautiful hotel- gorgeous exterior and a grand lobby. But the rooms are pretty standard for a five star hotel in India so what is all the fuss about? Yes, the iPod is pretty cool for controlling your lights, TV, etc, but I just don't get the fuss. Is it because they give you more bottles of Fiama di Wills toiletries (an ITC brand) than anyone could possibly use?   Patio and pool were gorgeous. Be sure to set some time aside to lounge there.  Very nice breakfast with lots of Indian and Western options. Be sure to order a masala dosa and filter coffee- very good. But I could not get a decent cup of tea no matter how many times I asked them to make sure the water was boiling to steep the tea properly.  I stayed for a week with a one-night break in between. During the first few…"

The Park Chennai,Did the Trick,4,"Overall, not a bad place to stay.  The reception, leather bar and restaurant are all very welcoming.  My room was clean and well presented, and allowed access to the lounge bar between 6.30-8.30 on weeknights (unfortunately I only found out about this towards the end of my stay).  The gym was also well equiped with friendly staff.  Both restaurants - 601 & the Thai one offered very good food, although the service was slightly inconsistent.    Only let-down was on the driver front, where I 'accidentally' gave my driver from the airport my mobile on arrival.  Not mentioning any names, but he called four times of Friday night, then sent numerous messages offering to take me 'site seen' and the clincher, woke me up at 7am on Saturday morning when i desperately needed a sleep-in! …"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Stay in Radisson Blu Chennai,4,"I stayed in Chennai Radisson Blu on GRT road for one night on the way to Krishnapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The hotel is very close to the airport and on the main road connecting Chennai to Tambaram. Local train station is just behind the hotel on a walkable distance. This makes it convenient for moving around anywhere by taking either bus, auto or train which is cheaper compare to hire a taxi. The room was very comfortable. Especially, the cucumber facial gel, aloe vera shampoo, etc were a surprise. Room was very clean and neat. The food was fantastic with the local flavour.

Hilton Chennai,Great for Families,4,"I stayed in the Hilton Chennai in the beginning of this month with my family. Very welcoming atmosphere for the families. Staffs were so attentive and caring.  +Ve The manager was so concerned about 'make it right'. The towel art on our bed was excellent and amazing. The extended breakfast buffet were deliciously yummy. Very warm and secured atmosphere for families with small children. -Ve The chauffer service was overly priced. We were charged IRS.2000 for one trip, and on return we used the UBER which cost us below IRS.200 only.  The rooftop has a very foul smell, which was not from the hotel but the surrounding. It was a serious distraction from enjoying the pool and rooftop experience.…"
The Park Chennai,Easy access for business travellers,4,"This hotel offers great value for money however it also has it's drawbacks.  Both Security and service are lax - which is an issue, the bar and outdoor pool area adjacent to the 8th floor accommodation wing does not make it particularly pleasant or easy to negotiate to your room in the ate evening when returning from business meetings.  We also found it odd that a hotel of this standard would have only one bread toaster available in the whole hotel.  This was working the first day we went to breakfast however on the second and third days we were there - there was no toaster and the staff told us that they only had one - and it was broken.  On the plus side, the staff are very helpful, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, the beds are comfortable and the internet is good, the…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,"My experience at Hyatt, Chennai",4,"Hyatt Regency is located in Teynampet, on Anna Salai road, the bustling centre of the city of Chennai.It is 10-storied building with several spacious occupancies to choose from. This hotel is about 8-9 kms from the airport. The first and the foremost thing I liked is the simple courtesy of dedicated staff of the hotel posted in the airport itself to get their guests picked from the arrival and take to the hotel safely. There are alternate ways to reach the hotel very easily. 1. Take the Metro, which has begun to operate quite recently, from Airport station and get down at DMS station. The hotel stands almost adjacent to DMS metro station. It takes less than 30 minutes to reach the hotel on this route after coming outside the airport. Ticket fare is just Rs.50/-. 2. One can take…"

However, its aesthetic look from outside is tarnished as Metro Rail project is on with their infrastructure. Any one who looks it from outside may not appreciate but once we step into the Hotel really awesome. Very sprawling lobby with comfortable sitting arrangements.  To get on to further floors you have sufficient number of Lifts and one elevator.  The reception hall is really good and it can accomadate around 500 pax at a time. For moving crowd, even more than 1000 pax can be easily arranged. In my case I had around 1300 pax for my daughters wedding reception. Besides this they also provided special VIP rooms.

This hotel too has a lot to offer in terms of comfort, ambiance, helpful and courteous staff and ofcourse Great rooms!!  What they fell short of is quality of food and kind of menu served in the Spice Haat restaurant. Having stayed in different Hyatt properties across the country and abroad as well I feel they have long way to go in terms of food. I found the menus to be average and not very exciting for someone who's looking forward to a great meal after a long day at work.  e.g. I complained on the first day of visit that coconut chutney was ""hot"" due to amount of green chillies in it so the Chef needs to be make it a bit mild...second day again I asked…"

My first stay in this property...managed by a wonderful team who takes care of your every need...the only sad part being due to some silly rule of the government the hotel was not allowed to serve alcohol but in-house guests can buy alcohol and get it should they need...  Stay at ITC and your every need will be taken care of...I love their sleep paraphernalia...a small box next to your bed which holds sleep music in a USB...a spray for ure pressure points and pillow, ear plugs and eye mask...you could order hot chocolate or other sleep inducing concoctions...  The rooms is large (I usually stay at ITC One rooms) very smartly…"
GreenPark Chennai,Exceptional Hospitality at Greenpark Hotels in South India,4,"I have been staying in Greenpark Chennai for the last few business visits, a little over a year. However I have experience of the same hotel in Hyderabad and Vizag as well. They are all exceptional in customer service. I remember a few years back I arrived at Greenpark Vizag with a bad cold with running nose, sore throat etc. The bell boy who was escorting me to the room, asked me politely, in good English whether I need any medicine? On my replying that I have already taken some, he said, ""Ok sir I shall send you warm water for drinking"". And it was there in my room within 5 minutes.I was moved. In my experience of so many 5 star hotels in and out of India I had never seen this kind of intelligent personal care. Chennai Greenpark is very good property, with a big spacious…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Excellent Business Hotel,4,"Stayed for 10 days. Food, ambiance are excellent. Staff is extremely co operative and special mention must be made of Housekeeping services for perfect upkeep. They go to the extent of providing in your room besides regular services small murals made out of bath towel which amazes you. I never saw any such thing in my 30 years of business travel all over the world. Madhu for doing the above and Taufik from Housekeeping deserves special mention.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent hotel with one weak spot,4,"In general was a fantastic hotel -- the pool area was one of the nicest I've experienced in Indian hotels.  I had a Towers Room (entry-level) and it was excellent -- the I-Pad controls for the room worked well.  We worked through the weekend, so we used several of the restaurants, all were very good - good service and good food.  The hotel is large with an incredible amount of Marble, and the staff is keeping it in first class shape.   The only issue I had was with the front desk staff -- they seemed like they were trained and managed by a different team.  My check-in was with a poorly trained associate, who I happened to catch the next morning and he was unable to even comprehend how he would find the conference room that my assistant had reserved, he didn't know and didn't see…"
Taj Club House,Excellent Business Hotel,4,"Its a great property in the heart of the city. Everything is very near and hence communication with any transport is very easy. We stayed here for 2 nights and all the staffs are very helpful and professional. The room which I stayed here was on the 5 floor and was of decent size, we would have preferred a little more private bath place (not translucent glass enclosure) as we were travelling with our toddler son. Hotel staff paid attention to details, they even sent a tray of chocolates for our son.  Being basically a business hotel, I would have appreciated free internet but it was a paid service. Buffet breakfast was of 5 star standards as you would expect. Swimming pool on 7th floor was clean and average size. I would make special note to the honest and diligent staffs in…"

This place is very grand and opulent at every step. you will easily get confused if you are not familiar. Everything is good about this place. Again as it happened at ITC Gardenia Bangalore, when I went for breakfast here, I found the cup having cracks.. of course they replaced it, but this should not happen in this kind of hotel. I appreciate the hotel staff, when they told me during breakfast that they do not advice having orange juice as it is not good/ bad quality. Overall good experience again.…"

Its a beautiful palatial property which will make your stay in Chennai a very pleasant experience. I booked the suite which was spacious but you could have been furnished better.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Truly Grand,4,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 week on a mix of business and pleasure.  Many hotels state they are grand, but this hotel truly lives up to its name. It's huge, with a mix of long term residence, business men/women and a scattering of vacationers.  The hotel is located about 15min from Chennai International Airport by a hotel arranged car, and the transfer was smooth.   Being SPG Platinum I was upgraded to a larger Towers Room, which was ample in size with a well thought out layout. The room was clean, shower hot, internet fast and king bed very comfortable. All room functions are controlled by a house ipad, which is very responsive and a great novelty. The hotel has only been open a couple of years, and as such not all it's entertainment and shopping facilities are up and running…"

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,The GRT experience,4,"Ever since my last visit and stay at Radisson Blu, GRT Chennai, I have decided never to look for any other hotels for my stay unless there are other compulsions. The ambience is good, location ideal and restaurants very varied and good.May be the only thing I find marginally negative is the trafiic en route to the hotel. But that is not the fault of the hotel. Plus the hospitality and warmth in the hotel more than compensates the traffic buzzle.…"
Taj Club House,Trendy Taj ,4,"Stayed recently for two nights and truly a satisfying experience. The decor is trendy and elegant supplemented by nice ambiance. Breakfast and Dinner buffet spread at the clubhouse was terrific. Spicy chicken and the fish rolls were terrific starter. Sweet options were limited but the delicacy could not be denied. Breakfast was as usual a tasty experience with dosa, idly and sambars were superb. Only downside is the slow service not only at the restaurant but even the room service was at its new low in Taj. But Tajness was there all around with smiling and polite staffs and an elegant lounge. The roof top Mediterranean joint was billed as wonderful but not tasted yet. The gym and swimming pool (barring pigeon presence) with Spa were a huge plus at the roof top. The room I stayed…"
The Park Chennai,My stay here on the night of 1st July to 2nd July morning.,4,"Was flying in from mumbai on the early morning of 2nd july 2018. Stayed here since my grandchild's first birthday celebrations were held here. The quality & cleanliness & comfort of the room were top class.

The morning buffet breakfast had a very good spread and the noteworthy item was vadacurry. Wish I could have stayed here longer. Thank you The Park, Chennai.…"

The Park Chennai,Wonderful experience!,4,"The Park chennai, is a class of its own in the heart of the city near to the airport. I had been there for my visa interview and had a good time. Its my first time in a 7 star hotel! Although its a bit expensive for a night costing from 7K Rupees to 15k rupees, the luxury is guaranteed! It has a swimming pool in the top floor, the breakfast buffet is good, the overall service is good. The Cab service is also very good and you can go around many places from the hotel and its in the right place of the city i would say.   The Rooms were very neat and big. There was a fine watch over the details of the room which was very good. :) And yeah, the spa experience - which comes at a discount price was the best for me!…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Special stay with family,4,"We have a year old baby and we stayed at the Chola tower between Jan 7-12 2014. It was a good experience. The rooms are spacious(if its a tower room) and if you have a baby who crawls. While the fridge in the room had broken down and therefore the food we carried for the baby was spoilt.. However, we had some lovely assistance from the housekeeping and in room dining team especially when it came to baby food. The chefs understood the anxiety of a mom travelling with a baby and created some nutritious dal bhaat/khichadi/porridge recipes for our baby.  thanks to MAdras Pavilion and CHef Nikhil and Chef Padma. One of the days I was craving home made Rasam and rice with potato roast and Voil the Chefs churned that for us too! Kudos.!   We also celebrated the baby's birthday in a…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent Property,4,"Excellent property, Brand new and little too large.Entrance is slightly confusing. One has to go around the hotel and use the back gate to enter. Reception is great and service quality is really great.  Scope for improvement -  1. The study table is just below the TV.

The Park Chennai,Nice for a short stay in Chennai,4,"Returned to The Park, Chennai after almost 3 years and was pleased to see nicely refurbished rooms (8th floor). As always, The Park is a decent place to stay when in Chennai - for business travellers and families alike. Compared to previous years, the in-room dining charges have increased substantially and this is something for guests to consider. Room service is quick, menu options are impressive. It also has a good location in Chennai.…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Massive Structure ........Excels in most departments!!!!,4,"Huge hotel and its easier said than done to maintain such a massive structure and though there is always room for improvement, I am not being critical here as ITC is doing a commendable job.  Everybody has their own tastes and likings And for me I like grand atrium type lobbies,but here the center stage is given to a grand staircase and the seating and reception counter doesn't seem to match the scale of the hotel, although there are plenty of seating scattered at different levels of the hotel but I missed a normal large lobby with plenty of seating [its purely a choice and by no means a negative point here] Check in experience was so so and I would like to forget it. It certainly didn't match the ITC luxury collection level.Check out was ok. I stayed in the towers room which…"

External look of the building is a bit garish and unlike a Taj hotel. However, the facilities and set-up are pleasing and comfortable.

Not a Taj but a good business hotel!…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Incredible place, but almost too incredible for it's own good",4,"This is a fabulous place, there is no doubt about it, one can see that there was no expense spared in the building. I was in a towers room for business, and the room was very well sized with a large connected bathroom area. Room cleanliness was less than I had expected - lots of greasy dust around the air conditioning intakes and a number of the power sockets were pulling away from the walls. The view from the room is of the newly completed (but as yet unfinished) Chennai Metro and a very busy road.  The windows are excellently insulated however, and none of the incredible road noise enters the room.  Blackout curtains ensure a decent night's sleep.  The staff are very obliging, but there are almost too many of them, meals were interrupted by waiter after waiter asking how the…"
Hilton Chennai,Not the best of the Hiltons,4,The hotel commands a 2-3K premium over its contemporary Radisson which i dont think is justified. I did reserve this Hotel with the condition to do check-out at my requested timing which was later not accepted by the Staff there. i ordered in-room breakfast and was impressed with the generous quantity (taste was great too!). Lot of construction activities going around Hilton and doesn't offer a pleasant view to the residents.…

It has huge ballrooms, with very good kebab restaurant. The check it toon quite long for such a level of hotel, should improve. Rooms are spacious and comfortable.the complimentary laundry (up to 4 pieces in 6hrs) is a differential. One of the best options in Chennai !!! Negative point accounts on wifi charged.

GreenPark Chennai,The table by the Pool fantasy and the best chef this side of the town!,4,"Me and my wife, just like that decided to go out for dinner and were searching for barbecue joints in the city, then by chance came across a BBQ joint in GreenPark which is  super close to where i live.  First, the weather in chennai was awesome that night and the romance of sitting by the pool was enticing enough to us to give it a try. So we did!  The menu was like ok ok and not too inviting enough, but the starters brought in by the CHEF Sujith was nice to linger around more. The chef was interested enough on his guests to constantly make rounds to all tables and it was nice to see him interacting with guests, this has become a rarity in restaurants nowadays.  He made sure we were served all the starters and refills again to make us high on them alone, so we almost skipped…"
The Park Chennai,"Very chic, probably still the coolest place to stay in Chennai",4,"The Park grabs your attention...right from the foyer with the high ceilings and the pure white screens..this place continues to have a great vibe  If you are looking for a place to unwind after a hard day of work in the heat and dust of chennai...slip into the leather bar, and nurse your drink while the volume slowly gets cranked up through the night  The food at 601 is decent and you grab a bite and decent service there at anytime, but don't try getting a table after the bars shut between midnight and two - it can get a little crowded, it would be great if they kept the wood fired ovens open till that late - in case you are looking for a mid night pizza!  Rooms are well appointed...as you would expect from a park hotel, and don't forget to check out the spa - one of the better…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Amazing hotel but the Spa could do so much better,4,"-Many great things about this hotel, the food quality is amazing. I used the Cafe Mercara express and the Madras Pavillon . If you are a true epicurean you will like the choice given to you in this hotel.  -My room as modern, clean and fitted with amenities that you expect of a 5 stars place. The big plus and fun thing to use is the Ipad in your room which allows you to control many facilities including the camera outside your door, you can also open your door with the Ipad. You are provided with infos about the hotel and things to do outside (areas to visit and a little of history). the Ipad is a very nice tool! -The gym and the pool areas are great for a good workout and some time to relax. -The staff everywherearound the premises  were friendly and professional and again it…"

I couldnt eat anything except for the desert... The staff were very considerate and offered me a plate with yogurt to help.  I had most of my meals at Mercara Cafe, with good options of sandwiches and pastas, the expresso was very nice as well. Front desk and cab service needs improvement, they need to be more dinamic and improve their way to organize the agenda, they are taking notes in a peace of paper.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nice but over-hyped,4,"Beautiful hotel- gorgeous exterior and a grand lobby. But the rooms are pretty standard for a five star hotel in India so what is all the fuss about? Yes, the iPod is pretty cool for controlling your lights, TV, etc, but I just don't get the fuss. Is it because they give you more bottles of Fiama di Wills toiletries (an ITC brand) than anyone could possibly use?   Patio and pool were gorgeous. Be sure to set some time aside to lounge there.  Very nice breakfast with lots of Indian and Western options. Be sure to order a masala dosa and filter coffee- very good. But I could not get a decent cup of tea no matter how many times I asked them to make sure the water was boiling to steep the tea properly.  I stayed for a week with a one-night break in between. During the first few…"

It ranged from casual to fine dining. I had dinner at the Italian and the seafood pasta dish was nice - although it was a little pricy. The buffet breakfast was AMAZING! I thoroughly enjoyed this every morning with so much variety and choice from Indian to hot breakfast to pastries and cereals.

As soon as I walked in, the staff made me feel extremely welcome and have me the 5 star service. I stay in a lot of hotels in the uk, including hiltons, and I have to say, the uk staff should take note! Some ppl on here have commented about a damp smell: I too noticed it, although to be fair it's been 40c and extremely humid. Couple that with excellent air con and there's bound to be something that meets in the middle. Didn't bother me at all.  The q bar on the terrace was a great place to relax after a busy day, and their food was impeccable.   My honest feedback is that I didn't expect tho to be paying London prices for food. …"

One of the Reception Desk staff members (Shalom) very kindly showed us around the hotel and explained the various restaurants and facilities. The room (one if the ITC Chola rooms) was well appointed and we settled in comfortably for a short sleep before the day started. We started our day with a visit to the Madras Pavilion for a buffet lunch and found this to have a wide range on Indian and International foods. Waiting staff were very attentive – perhaps too much so and we felt at times that we were being watched whilst eating. We had breakfast the next morning at the same venue and found it to be somewhat hectic with large numbers of guests all vying for…

I used the Cafe Mercara express and the Madras Pavillon . If you are a true epicurean you will like the choice given to you in this hotel.  -My room as modern, clean and fitted with amenities that you expect of a 5 stars place. The big plus and fun thing to use is the Ipad in your room which allows you to control many facilities including the camera outside your door, you can also open your door with the Ipad. You are provided with infos about the hotel and things to do outside (areas to visit and a little of history). the Ipad is a very nice tool! -The gym and the pool areas are great for a good workout and some time to relax. -The staff everywherearound the premises  were friendly and professional and again it…"

GreenPark Chennai,Stayed with my family for 2 weeks - fantastic experience,4,"We paid a visit to India in mid October - myself, my wife, our two young children and my parents.  Since our relatives didn't have enough space for all of us, we elected to stay at the Green Park.  We stayed at the hotel for nearly two weeks and were treated wonderfully.  The hotel itself is quite nice, maybe not palatial but quite good.  Our big accolade, though, has to be for the staff - we got to know them quite well, and they were always accommodating, even with sudden / unusual requests, especially when it came to what we needed for the kids.  Never without a smile, everyone always said hello, and it's worth saying that my kids got candies and balloons every single day from the front desk (is that a good thing?)!! The buffet was fine, and the formal dining restaurant was…"

Great shower pressure and very large high quality towels. Bed was above average comfortable with good linens and pillow selection. Had dinner one night at the Kabab Factory, food was good and plentiful with an interesting theme. Staff was friendly and value was a bit expensive, but don't miss the experience.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Good Luxury, bad housekeeping",4,Stayed there during an inhouse conference recently. Good rooms and hospitality but poor housekeeping. The used plates from in-room catering left out by the adjacent room guests weren't cleared from the corridors for almost 18hours. Room windows are littered by pigeon droppings. Asked for an extended checkout and was confirmed by the reservations but wasn't updated in my record. As a result the access card stopped functioning at their stipulated check out time and I was put to some inconvenience. Overall has scope for more imrpovement…
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",One of the decent hotels ever stayed!!,4,"Recently I flew down all the way from San Fransico to Chennai for a short vacation when I got a chance to stay in this hotel for the initial 2 days,   All I can say about the hotel was clean and neat, Pretty much OKAY among 4 start hotel categories.  It's actually a value for money if you book it through some deals.  Certainly, there is some room for improvement in the amenities provided. For instance, I had some wi-fi issues which got sorted out later in the morning.   Despite that, I liked their hospitality service very much. All the staffs working in this hotel were really sincere about their job duties and supportive enough.  Right from the security person, receptionists, housekeeping, Restaurant ppl were so dedicated to their work and welcomed everyone with a smile on their…"

Taj Club House,Nice Business Hotel in the heart of the City,4,"Stay here for 2 nights. Was a surprise find as I got a good deal online. External look of the building is a bit garish and unlike a Taj hotel. However, the facilities and set-up are pleasing and comfortable. Staff seems relatively new but tries very hard to please and does a decent job of it.  Rooms are comfortable and functional. Bathrooms are a bit small but decent enough.  Not a Taj but a good business hotel!…"
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,"Good location, good service",4,Location is excellent if you are catching an early morning flight. The service is very prompt and helpful. The room had a slightly musty odor which could have been avoided. The massage chair in the room was a nice touch. Wifi was fast and free (no exorbitant amount that hotels charge). Overall I would recommend it for a short stay.…
Hilton Chennai,Decent,4,"I found it very decent. Rooms are excellent and comfortable. Restaurants are good, food is excellent. The only thing I found missing is the warmth in the service.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Grand as the names suggests,4,"Recently stayed for a couple of nights on a business trip. Needless to say, this is one of the top hotels in the city. Absolute stunning interior with a lot of classy touch and decor. It literally feels inside a grand palace than anything else. The property is absolutely massive in size with about 5 entry points/porches as they call.  Room was also pretty nice and cozy. Liked the touch of modernization in the room in the form of the tablet control for everything including door open/shut. The bathroom was spacious and grand as well. Literally a page out of luxury. Wifi was very good, which is almost a basic need these days. The pool is amazing. Size may not be massive but the area around if awesome. A perfect place to kick back and enjoy the sun or a swim. Plenty of food options…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Zestful Stay,4,"The Chennai property is in keeping with the consistency and ambience which has become the hallmark of the Lemon Tree group. Barely 8km from the airport makes it a preferred choice and the airport pickup service was efficiently carried out. Check in was smooth and all the instructions for local hire of cab for two days was smoothly executed. As a Platinum member the upgrade to the fourth floor was welcome.The room was large and spacious with a pleasant view and tastefully decorated and equipped. The In-room dining menu was small but adequate and the staff courteous and helpful. Breakfast is varied and served in the Citrus cafe on the ground floor which is the coffee shop for the hotel. While the hotel is well located, it is on a busy thorough fare which makes it a little…"

GreenPark Chennai,Gem of a hotel in Chennai,4,"We were in Chennai for four days for a friend's wedding and stayed at Green Park for three nights as it was the closest hotel to the venue (very centrally located in the middle of a busy area but built sufficiently off the main street so that there is no noise pollution once you enter the hotel premises).   Not only was the hotel very reasonable, but also we were well taken care of and our stay was a pleasant one. The buffet breakfast (included in the room rate) was a sumptuous spread of Indian and continental cuisine apart from a heady variety of juices, salads and preserves, etc. We ate at one of the hotel's restaurants (Once upon a time) for just one meal (as we were out for the most part of the day) and enjoyed the food. The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and clean. Other…"

The Park Chennai,Business Stay in Park Chennai,4,"The hotel is located bang on the center of the city and is an iconic place in the city as almost everyone seems to know about this place. The US consulate was almost a stone throw away from the hotel but I would warn you about the super crazy traffic you need to cross before getting there.  Was made to wait for the rooms when I arrived at the hotel and came to know that their check in time was only 2 PM but I had made it to the hotel by 8. Was informed about the approx. wait time for my room and was also offered alternatives as they were completely full (came to know that this is quite the situation day in day out). Was provided with a code to access the internet but was valid only for 2 hours.  Tried the coffee shop for breakfast, where the filter coffee was an amazing…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Nice but over-hyped,4,"Beautiful hotel- gorgeous exterior and a grand lobby. But the rooms are pretty standard for a five star hotel in India so what is all the fuss about? Yes, the iPod is pretty cool for controlling your lights, TV, etc, but I just don't get the fuss. Is it because they give you more bottles of Fiama di Wills toiletries (an ITC brand) than anyone could possibly use?   Patio and pool were gorgeous. Be sure to set some time aside to lounge there.  Very nice breakfast with lots of Indian and Western options. Be sure to order a masala dosa and filter coffee- very good. But I could not get a decent cup of tea no matter how many times I asked them to make sure the water was boiling to steep the tea properly.  I stayed for a week with a one-night break in between. During the first few…"
Hilton Chennai,Well worth a Stay,4,"Fantastic experience all around. Excellent well appointed rooms. Top class service all around. Nice ambience.

The Park Chennai,Good hospitality,4,Stayed for one night at this place. There were initial hiccups with the airport transfer which we had booked along with making the reservation but for some unknown reason inspite of reminders they couldnt find the booking for the airport pick up and this was a big mess when I checked into the hotel. But the duty manger Mr. Seni was very receptive to feedback and left no stone unturned in making the rest of the stay comfortable and all issues taken care of. The ambience and location of the hotel is very good. Staff is quite courteous. I hope they can take care of the disconnect which I see with the travel desk and the reservation system.…
Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Good quality business hotel,4,"Having arrived in the early hours our transfer and check in was smooth and efficient.  Stayed in room 123 which was large with a shower and Jacuzzi bath. Lots of bottled water available in the room which was a nice touch.  We ate in the main restaurant area which catered well for our Western tastes, especially the awesome stilton pizza.   All staff were helpful, especially Rajavel who was always seeking ideas from us on how to improve the hotel in any way, obviously cared for our honest opinions. He is a credit to this hotel, a positive proactive employee.  The only negative I can think of was the cab ride to a business we had to travel to, an 80km trip. The cab was arranged through the hotel, I showed a copy of the address to the driver and relevant hotel employee and was…"
Taj Club House,Worth a stay!!!,4,"I stayed here in October as the first stop of my Chennai-Mahabalipuram-Pondicherry trip. Its nearer from the Chennai Railway Station and a little far from the airport. Its located quite centrally about 5mins from the famous spencer plaza and very the express mall. Its also pretty equidistant from all the places you want to visit in Chennai - the marina beach, museum, Elliot's beach the temples, the T. Nagar market place. In fact its better to stay at a hotel in Chennai central than staying at a hotel near the airport because the Chennai traffic may eat up quite a bit of your time. The only approach road is a little dingy for hosting a Taj hotel. The Taj Coromandel a little away is a better option on that score.  I have stayed in various Taj properties in Delhi due to me…"
The Park Chennai,"Good location, courteous and helpful staff",4,I stayed at the Park for 1 day and had a pleasant experience. Very helpful staff.

Taj Club House,Hospitality par excellence!,4,"Stayed for the first time in this property due to proximity to the Belgian Consulate, where I had some work to attend to. Being a city location not much of a view which is understandable but they make up for it with their excellent hospitality and sincere professionalism. E.g.:  I had asked for an airport transfer, which they duly confirmed by email, text message and a phone call the previous evening. After arriving at the hotel and much before their official check-in time, the Duty Manager Mr Vijit voluntarily upgraded me to a suite - very welcome! Being busy and there being no liquor in the restaurants due to the absurd new regulations, I stayed in and had all my meals in-room. Again, prompt service and high quality food at reasonable prices compared to the typical 5-star in…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Live like a modern Chola,4,"Take time out when you visit this one. Possibly one of the most eagerly anticipated hotel openings in recent times in India, ITC’s Grand Chola has been in the making for the better part of the last decade. As it finally opens, I got some sneak previews of the hotel, and though it is far from complete, and only partially open, there are already glimmers of what lies ahead.    It is India’s largest hotel in floor area, and built to scale. Located in Guindy, on the way to the airport, it should be accessible to business travelers easily. It’s a massive structure, and the numbers just reinforce it.  It’s a 600-room hotel, spread over 1.5 million square feet in an eight acre plot. It has 100,000 square feet of banqueting and convention space which includes 30,000 square feet of…"

True to it's name, overall ambiance is grand. Multiple seating options placed in lobby provides good option to sit and relax.  Rooms are well kept (stayed in east wing 2446), spacious with all basic expected amenities. Controls managed through Ipad, wifi was highly priced though.  I liked the room view which was directly opposite the Pool.  Coming to Staff -- This is where it falters. At check in, we waited for 20 mins before anyone could attend to us (there were 3 people manning the counter). It was 8.30 at night and not expected after a long day.   We had our dinner at 'Cafe Mercara Express'.The staff looked pre occupied with only 30% tables occupancy. Though staff was courteous, you had to look around repeatedly to get…"

He is very welcoming & attends to all the genuine needs to facilitate our stay here a pleasant one. Also Mr. Zahir Hussain, the Asst. F&B Manager without mentioning whose name this review would be incomplete. He is also very much attentive to the the needs of inmates & takes care of F&B division in an excellent manner.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",In the lap of luxury,4,"The ITC Chola is an epitome of grandeur and luxury. The sheer size, opulent interiors leaves you dumbstruck. But the flip side of it being you tend to feel lost a bit too.  I stayed for a night on business and felt it too short a period to just get a glimpse of the entire hotel. The room was great with a comfy bed and some very jazzy interiors. The somewhat let down was ITC trying to market their own products especially the toiletries. A fab place like this deserves better.  Had a great breakfast and must admit haven't had such wonderful idlis for a very long time.  Overall service was very warm and courteous and leaves you feeling pampered.  Overall a very enjoyable but short stay but I will be back for more…"
Taj Club House,Very reliable business hotel,4,"I stayed here for two nights and found it to be very good. Reception on arrival was warm and welcoming. The explantation of the hotel facilities was thorough. The hotel has a good choice of restaurants, which were of a very good standard. I particularly enjoyed my meal at Beyond Indus. The pool is a good size, if not a bit shallow and cold! The view from the rooftop is impressive and sets a good backdrop for dinner at the Mediterranean-themed rooftop restaurant. The gym, overlooking the pool is well equipped and well used. The spa is typical Taj Jiva fare, with reliably good service. The rooms are disappointing, but standard business-hotel stuff. They are relatively compact, with shower (no bath), good toiletries, comfortable bed, large tv, usual facilities (iron, safe, wifi…"

However  like all centrally located hotels be prepared for traffic congestion and noise while entering and exiting.  The hotel is built on the grounds of the erstwhile Gemini Studios, and the contemporary look of the hotel which is bright and funky  is mixed with retro-posters of old films in the rooms and corridors,   This is now beginning to look worn out and faded.  Rooms are fairly large, comfortable and clean but again need a facelift, views are not great, most overlook an  abandoned building. Bathrooms are old fashioned and there were patches of peeling paint.  By way of dining options, there is a  good Thai restaurant worth…"

There are alternate ways to reach the hotel very easily. 1. Take the Metro, which has begun to operate quite recently, from Airport station and get down at DMS station.

Hilton Chennai,Convenient with one flaw!,4,"I had just done a review on the Meluha The Fern in Mumbai praisng them on the little things that make a hotel comfortable and I travelled to Chennai and stayed at the Hilton. I found that the little things that make a hotel just that much more comfortable were missing at the hilton. I cannot believe that the Hilton chain would remove the simple things like even a toothbrush from the rooms. The room was fine, comfortable and the food excellent but to find only a shower cap and a bar of soap beside the sink just cheapened the hotel.…"

Pros: Near to Airport, Near to the institutional areas and tech parks, 3 swimming pools, spa and health centre. Cons: The hotel lobby has very strong floral smells due to strong air fresheners and East wing 8th floor pathways are not maintained well carpets are full of dust smell so people like me can be allergic to it........

GreenPark Chennai,Nice Hotel,4,"Nice huge hotel, beautifully done. I stayed for 2 nights and was very happy. The location is next to a mall and few other hotels and restaurants including Vasanta Bhavan.   Rooms were of good size. The TV was quite small - that was the only let down.I had a room on the 5th floor which had swimming pool view.   The bar is large and with good service but was quite uninteresting. The ambience is not consistent with the rest of the hotel. It neither had any music nor comfortable seating. There were people in large groups (probably sales folks or small businessmen) who were drinking and having loud conversations. They provided excellent and abundant munchies.   Please note that the prices on food and liquor menus are without taxes (which these days amount to a large number). On room…"
The Park Chennai,"Very convenient, but definitely needs some improvements",4,"Finished my visa interview today and stayed at the Park for that. The park is very convenient in terms of location for the visa process and all the staff at the hotel know everything about the process. For instance, the security guards helped me find an auto to the bio-metric center. And it is obviously just 2 road crossings away from the consulate. And I was happy that they accommodated a check-in one hour earlier than the usual 2 pm time since I could manage only a 9 am flight into Chennai. All in all a comfortable stay. All the staff were extremely warm, especially a lady in-charge on my floor (I forgot to note her name) who came to inquire about my comfort on two occasions and the duty manager Mr. Narasimhan who got my room changed because the first one had some knocking…"

The Park Chennai,Good Stay - Near to US Consulate,4,"I stayed here back in 2010 when I came to Chennai for my US Visa procedure. The best part it is right opposite to the US Consulate in Chennai. The Rooms were clean, Food was very average. Service was Average too. As a 5 star much more was expected out of the Hotel which it failed to provide. I felt the restaurant was a bit cramped. Could have provided wifi to the guests rather than a wired internet.…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Pleasant stay,4,"This is the ITC flagship in Chennai, a massive place with innumerable wings and lots and lots of corridors and empty spaces that will take a few days to get familiarised with. We spent the New Years night there in the Towers block, which is a little more luxury, separate entrance and check in desk. The rooms are massive , well decorated, with all the creature comforts one can think of, like AC, bath tub, shower cubicle, toiletries and in room mini bar and coffee /tea making facilities. Beds and pillows are quite comfortable. Guests in this block can go the residents room between 6 -8 PM for complimentary beverages, both alcoholic and non alcoholic, and snacks.

The Park Chennai,A good business hotel,4,"Have stayed in The Park twice on my official trips and kind of like the hotel. The lobby is nice and big giving you a feeling like you are in a really big place, which is not entirely true but that's a nice play.   I like the posters of old flicks in the lobbies and rooms though the posters in the room should have been better chosen. The room I stayed in had a hand drawn poster of a horror movie and that's kind of pissing off when you get up in the morning.   The breakfast is fantastic and you need to really hold yourself back if you have meetings lined up. They have lovely South Indian fare and live counters. Really really nice breakfast.   The highlight is of course the swimming pool at the terrace. It doubles up as a great outdoor lounge at night and it is great fun to laze…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Grand Chola - Started Great but . .,4,"I first stayed at the ITC Grand Chola last year, just after it had opened.  I loved it and was looking forward to my return this year.  However, I was somewhat disappointed..  The hotel is still an amazing and luxurious piece of work but some of its gloss has fallen away and the management team need to be careful.  The signature iPAD controller in my room was not working  . . . Some of the electrical points were beginning to come away from the wall and it seemed impossible to get a hot coffee at breakfast time.  Overall the experience just wasn't as magical as before. .   But, by far, my biggest gripe in this hotel is the chairs / sofa's in the restaurant / lobby areas . .  Every single chair in this hotel is so firm that it is incredibly uncomfortable !  It's like they designed…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Impressive hotel, very comfortable",4,"A magnificent hotel - all marble hallways, very high ceilings and an impression of space, chandeliers, high quality and grandeur!  It is beautiful and maintained in top condition.  Our standard room was huge with a beautiful bathroom and dressing area.  The lighting and security in the room was high-tech, worked from a tablet and at night lights would be activated through movement in the room, avoiding any necessity to grope around for a switch! The swimming pool was also very nice. The only downside for us was a seeming lack of good quality mid-range restaurants nearby, which meant that for our two nights there, we had to eat in one of the hotel's restaurants, which were expensive!  (Food and drink were expensive to start with, here, and were priced without taxes - by the time…"

Stayed in room 123 which was large with a shower and Jacuzzi bath. Lots of bottled water available in the room which was a nice touch.  We ate in the main restaurant area which catered well for our Western tastes, especially the awesome stilton pizza.   All staff were helpful, especially Rajavel who was always seeking ideas from us on how to improve the hotel in any way, obviously cared for our honest opinions. He is a credit to this hotel, a positive proactive employee.  The only negative I can think of was the cab ride to a business we had to travel to, an 80km trip. The cab was arranged through the hotel, I showed a copy of the address to the driver and relevant hotel employee and was…"

There's a club atmosphere to the place, especially in the 'Slounge' - a bar with attitude!.It's well run by efficient and friendly staff who go out of their way to be helpful. The housekeeping staff are meticulous in their attention to detail and the cleanliness of the rooms was amongst the best we found on this trip. The restaurant served a delicious buffet and the food deleivered by room service was well presented and good quality. The pool, although small, was clean and a welcome oasis from the busy streets outside. On the more negative side - the large number of males amongst the guests made the public areas (especially the 'Slounge' )…"

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Hyatt Hospitality,4,"Short Stay, 2 nights for a business trip. Quite near to the hotel, approximately 40 mins to reach there.

I ended up paying for pre paid cab & after the transaction a man with a Hyatt board came up. The hotel is entrance is already making an impression w/ a cool huge art hanging. The check in was pretty quick & we were upgraded to  room that was just oh so nice. Living room + a work place + a clean bathroom + a comfy looking bed ( pillow was not that great though).

Taj Club House,Overall a good stay,4,I stayed here recently while working in Chennai. I have always stayed at the currently closed Connemara so unfortunately my observations were often made with comparison to that superior hotel. The staff at Taj hotels are always friendly and professional. During our stay individuals from the American navy checked in. They were not a credit to their country and the hotel management did not seem keen to do anything about the situation. However once we had complained the management took action beyond the expected and I sincerely thank them. The negative points do seem picky but these improvements would help guests.  Improve information in rooms such as restaurant opening times and local information and a tv channel guide Give more information on the room to room dialling service…

Rooms are well appointed...as you would expect from a park hotel, and don't forget to check out the spa - one of the better…"

The house keeping service was very good and the girl who cleaned our room (Rathi) always put a smile on our face with small gestures like decorate the floor with petals of roses in the shape of a heart really captured my heart.  The laundry service was good and fast eventhough sometime i did wonder did they really wash the clothes because of the mark of my lipstick on one of the t-shirt being there despite of 3 or 4 washes. Also there was a small problem with the laundry bill while checking out which they sorted out after bringing to their attention.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Spacious looking room and design - good stay,4,"Spent only a day in the hotel but I loved the room. The staff were pleasant and ready to assist you with anything. Breakfast buffet was super with excellent choice. One thing which was different here was, the lobby was in the first floor or so. Usually you expect to enter to a lobby spacious and beautiful which was missing here. Though the upstairs lobby was indeed pretty. One more thing I noticed is the small sized toothbrush..

Breakfast is good enough,did have dinner one night from a-la-carte, chef's special was excellent,Though this is not in the same class as some other hotels in Chennai, it makes it up with the excellent staff in their roster. Some of their support staff are specially able-d which is a nice touch of class.

For travellers on holidays, don't expect too much in terms of service.    Room - good size with standard amenities.  No fruit basket or special welcome for staying in suites.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Good rooms and a great atrium ,4,Been here for the first time. I liked the hotel's interiors and various restaurants. The lobby is an interesting area with the Lobby Lounge just behind the reception. The lads at the front desk are smart and good at their job. The check-in process was quick and I was escorted to my room by a front desk lady named Ruby.  The room was spacious and comfortable. Great beds and a perfect loo to take care of all my private issues! Good amenities and a tub. The room gave a good view of the pool below and some portion of the city can be seen from the nice huge glass pane of the room.  The house keeping lad on the 4th floor did not give me extra water bottles in-spite of 2 requests. So I will have to purchase water if need be!  The hotel provides a lounge seating  in the evening with…
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Great hotel and staff - for the most part,4,"We spent 3 nights in the Hyatta Regency, Chennai at the end of our 3 week holiday in Southern India.  The hotel is surrounded by works for the Chennai metro, so it's a bit of a challenge for taxis to get to the front door - which is a minor inconvenience beyond the hotel's control.  The hotel itself is impressive - particularly the foyer which has a floor to roof atrium which room floors overlook.  Overall we were happy with our stay - the room was spacious and well appointed, breakfast (included) was a sumptuous banquet and the staff were friendly, courteous and helpful.  The issue for us was the handling of the hiccup we encountered. After a rather full day (day 3 of our stay) exploring Chennai, we returned to our room at around 3:30pm to find it had not been serviced.   That…"

The buffet they served for breakfast was exhaustive ranging from continental cuisine, north indian to south indian. And it was delicious!  A very good hotel but lacks in its maintenance. Its an old property but it should be maintained as one of the lifts got stuck and emergency call had to be made...  Need to mention about the pool as well. Located on the top floor, one gets a wonderful view of the city. They have very nice sit outs where one can enjoy a beer while taking…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,"Great location, super room and conference service",4,Guest Room and Hotel Condition: Stayed on the Club Floor (8th floor). Very comfortable and spacious room. Loved the innovative combine of the bar counter extending to the washroom counter. Excellent amenities.  Loved the daily dessert surprise :)  The exterior of the hotel still stands testimony to the ravages of the December 2016 Cyclone Vadra.  We hope that restoration will commence soon.  The Metro (subway) construction shields the hotel entrance from sight. Lighting could perhaps be improved at the hotel entrance/exit point.   Staff interactions: Extremely courteous and helpful.  Perhaps a little over-staffed in the lobby area.  But then perhaps this is better than guests complaining that they had no one to interact with for queries.  Generously extended our stay by 2 hours…
Hilton Chennai,"High Hilton Standard, food requires improvement",4,"Arriving at the Hotel and after the standard security check was a typical Hilton experience. Professional staff, very friendly and yes I was upgraded. The room is very nice, clean and has all comfort one would desire and expect as frequent Hilton guest. Mist impressive was the exec lounge. I don‘t know how he did it, bit the friendly waiter always remembered the name of every single guest. Really made me feel valued and welcome. The only thing I would suggest to review is the breakfast buffet. I stayed 5 days, but did not find anything that satisfied my needs.

The Park Chennai,Had a good time,4,"This hotel is in the heart of the city and is well connected. I am regularly staying in this hotel during mu routine business visit to the city. Please be cautious while booking online as this chain has got one more property nearby in the name of The Park Pod which is a very small property basically with no amenities. The Park is a very good property for a stay mainly with lot of happening Restaurants, Pubs and a good night life especially Pasha which energizes you after a long working day. They are under the process of renovating the property phase wise and fortunately i managed to get a newly built up room which was excellent. Dont forget to try there soothing SPA…"
Taj Club House,Very Pleasant Stay for a Travelling Celiac!,4,"I am a diagnosed celiac (must have gluten free food) Was in Chennai on business for 3 days and was resigning myself to my default food when travelling: steak and vegetables. Which is great but gets bit monotonous after few days! I seldom try anyother food as I need to be 100% sure the kitchen understand that I cannot have any gluten at all.  Thus I ate steak and lamb from their main restaurant on first night and it was average. The next night I ventured into their Indian restaurant: Beyond Indus and told the head waiter about my celiac. He had the chef Nisi come around to discuss and I was blown away how understanding and helpful he was. Nisi cooking was delicious, fresh and gluten free! Would recommend this hotel for their BeyondIndus restaurant alone!…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,Great Service but felt Cheated this time,4,"This was my third visit to the Hyatt Regency Chennai in December 2015. I had a 4 day business trip to Chennai, I had stayed for two nights at Hyatt and had to move to Raintree, St. Mary's due to unavailability of rooms at the Hyatt Regency. The floods struck on the 3rd day and I had further booked Hyatt again for the next three days and decided to wait till the airport was scheduled to open (the airport was shut down for 3 days). The surprise comes here when the hotel allowed to book the rooms whereas the there was no way to enter the hotel as the entrance to the hotel was blocked due to water. I had booked the rooms through make my trip and paid for the 3 days in advance. Somehow managed to get out of chennai as the rooms in the other hotels were not available and when…"

Taj Club House,Very reliable business hotel,4,"I stayed here for two nights and found it to be very good. Reception on arrival was warm and welcoming. The explantation of the hotel facilities was thorough. The hotel has a good choice of restaurants, which were of a very good standard. I particularly enjoyed my meal at Beyond Indus. The pool is a good size, if not a bit shallow and cold! The view from the rooftop is impressive and sets a good backdrop for dinner at the Mediterranean-themed rooftop restaurant. The gym, overlooking the pool is well equipped and well used. The spa is typical Taj Jiva fare, with reliably good service. The rooms are disappointing, but standard business-hotel stuff. They are relatively compact, with shower (no bath), good toiletries, comfortable bed, large tv, usual facilities (iron, safe, wifi…"

GreenPark Chennai,Strongly recommend!! ,4,Nice private entrance on the arcot road just in between the Vijaya hospital and the Forum mall with a good parking capacity that suits this hotel. Very good hospitality at the main entrance and a lovely lobby with a Buddha statue. There seems to be many areas to explore within this hotel but I have only explored the Mustang lounge bar next to the lobby and the Escape pub at the basement so far. So I will just stick to the review of these 2 places. Mustang: Nice lounge bar with a projector screen and televisions all around with friendly bar tenders. Good place to hang out with a group of friends to chat if you are not particularly looking for music or any other entertainment. Escape: The area within this hotel exactly for a person like me. Well lit pool table which first draws me…

The Park Chennai,Pleasant Tallywood experience,4,"My stay at PARK CHENNAI was great and was with my client. Located in downtown Chennai offers you great access to the main business districts like T-Nagar etc..The DECOR of the hotel is the highlight and it is very unique..thanks to the ""old"" studio GEMINI STUDIO site of the hotel. Although there are now no signs of ""film studio"" in the area, the theme of the hotel is around the ""cinema"". The tensile structures in lobby recollect the old-time screens, the seating in a row make it look like a cinema hall seating. What I liked is they put ""mogra"" - ""jasmine"" flowers in evening at lobby level .. you can carry a fistful of them with you even in your room.The rooftop restaurant, pool-side parasols are just so trendy..carpets welcome you in front of the elevators - they have a nice…"

Hilton Chennai,Within easy reach of most destinations,4,"On first glance this is a lovely hotel. Roof top pool is nice and relaxing, being able to watch the traffic on the busy roads and trains on the metro lines. A steady stream of horn blowing I found quite amusing as they all sounded different. The Vintage Bank has a happy hour from 5.30 - 9.00pm, be warned use mosquito repellent before you venture down there. Staff are lovely and very helpful. Sid in the executive lounge was a rare find, so knowledgeable and pleasant with it. This lounge was great as no mosquitos;-)  Happy hour 6.30pm till 8.30pm with great snacks too. One thing that did let the hotel down was on two separate evenings we were awoken at 3am by maintenance work in the room above ours, Hammering and drilling. We complained on both evenings that this was unacceptable…"

The Park Chennai,Good hospitality,4,Stayed for one night at this place. There were initial hiccups with the airport transfer which we had booked along with making the reservation but for some unknown reason inspite of reminders they couldnt find the booking for the airport pick up and this was a big mess when I checked into the hotel. But the duty manger Mr. Seni was very receptive to feedback and left no stone unturned in making the rest of the stay comfortable and all issues taken care of. The ambience and location of the hotel is very good. Staff is quite courteous. I hope they can take care of the disconnect which I see with the travel desk and the reservation system.…
The Park Chennai,Business Stay in Park Chennai,4,"The hotel is located bang on the center of the city and is an iconic place in the city as almost everyone seems to know about this place. The US consulate was almost a stone throw away from the hotel but I would warn you about the super crazy traffic you need to cross before getting there.  Was made to wait for the rooms when I arrived at the hotel and came to know that their check in time was only 2 PM but I had made it to the hotel by 8. Was informed about the approx. wait time for my room and was also offered alternatives as they were completely full (came to know that this is quite the situation day in day out).

GreenPark Chennai,Good Quality Hotel,4,"Excellent service during my 2 week stay.  Room was clean and bathroom was of a very high quality.  Restaurant was excellent and offered a wide range of dishes.  Service was very good with waiters spending time to chat tome as I was dining alone.  Hotel offers good facilities with small gym, which I used, and spa treatments.  Area was extremely busy and unsettling until you get accustomed to the Chennai traffic - something to behold.  Extremely busy with cars and bikes continuously driving by.  That said the hotel if far enough away from the road for traffic noise not to be a problem.  I would certainly use the hotel again if I need to go back there on busy.…"
Hilton Chennai,Great for Families,4,"I stayed in the Hilton Chennai in the beginning of this month with my family. Very welcoming atmosphere for the families. Staffs were so attentive and caring.  +Ve The manager was so concerned about 'make it right'. The towel art on our bed was excellent and amazing. The extended breakfast buffet were deliciously yummy. Very warm and secured atmosphere for families with small children. -Ve The chauffer service was overly priced. We were charged IRS.2000 for one trip, and on return we used the UBER which cost us below IRS.200 only.  The rooftop has a very foul smell, which was not from the hotel but the surrounding. It was a serious distraction from enjoying the pool and rooftop experience.…"

Nice modern rooms, an infinity pool bar on the rooftop, some fair to good restaurants.

Hilton Chennai,"High Hilton Standard, food requires improvement",4,"Arriving at the Hotel and after the standard security check was a typical Hilton experience. Professional staff, very friendly and yes I was upgraded. The room is very nice, clean and has all comfort one would desire and expect as frequent Hilton guest. Mist impressive was the exec lounge. I don‘t know how he did it, bit the friendly waiter always remembered the name of every single guest. Really made me feel valued and welcome. The only thing I would suggest to review is the breakfast buffet. I stayed 5 days, but did not find anything that satisfied my needs. The sausages were not grilled, Bacon was not crisp, eggs tasted very non-tasty. Even egg benedict had 0 taste. Likewise the bread, the danish and even the local food had almost no taste.

GreenPark Chennai,Welcome Home,4,Greenpark is one of those gems offering @ home feeling. It is located on the most crowded part of the city - the vadapalani area near the kollywood studios. (You will get to see lot of small time celebrities when u visit this hotel). In my opinion they have the best staff in the city - they make you feel @ home.  The rooms are good with wooden flooring - although they could improve a little with the interiors. The bathroom is quite small. They dont keep the soap instead shower gel!!! The Wifi is free and good! The room service tastes good and presented well (they cover rotis individually in butter paper). This hotel has some of the best restaurants in town. They even have a barbecue by the pool - but chennai is quite sultry will make you sweat until you are soaked.  The even…

It is beautiful and maintained in top condition.  Our standard room was huge with a beautiful bathroom and dressing area.  The lighting and security in the room was high-tech, worked from a tablet and at night lights would be activated through movement in the room, avoiding any necessity to grope around for a switch! The swimming pool was also very nice. The only downside for us was a seeming lack of good quality mid-range restaurants nearby, which meant that for our two nights there, we had to eat in one of the hotel's restaurants, which were expensive!  (Food and drink were expensive to start with, here, and were priced without taxes - by the time…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Truly Grand,4,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 week on a mix of business and pleasure.  Many hotels state they are grand, but this hotel truly lives up to its name. It's huge, with a mix of long term residence, business men/women and a scattering of vacationers.  The hotel is located about 15min from Chennai International Airport by a hotel arranged car, and the transfer was smooth.   Being SPG Platinum I was upgraded to a larger Towers Room, which was ample in size with a well thought out layout. The room was clean, shower hot, internet fast and king bed very comfortable. All room functions are controlled by a house ipad, which is very responsive and a great novelty. The hotel has only been open a couple of years, and as such not all it's entertainment and shopping facilities are up and running…"

GreenPark Chennai,Gem of a hotel in Chennai,4,"We were in Chennai for four days for a friend's wedding and stayed at Green Park for three nights as it was the closest hotel to the venue (very centrally located in the middle of a busy area but built sufficiently off the main street so that there is no noise pollution once you enter the hotel premises).   Not only was the hotel very reasonable, but also we were well taken care of and our stay was a pleasant one. The buffet breakfast (included in the room rate) was a sumptuous spread of Indian and continental cuisine apart from a heady variety of juices, salads and preserves, etc. We ate at one of the hotel's restaurants (Once upon a time) for just one meal (as we were out for the most part of the day) and enjoyed the food. The rooms and bathrooms were spacious and clean. Other…"
Hyatt Regency Chennai,"peaceful surroundings, comfortable stay",4,"Location: The hotel is located about 20 minutes away from the main airport in Chennai. It is near some good shopping areas such as T. Nagar. It is about 15 minutes from the Mylapore area where the Kapaleeswarar Temple is.   Food: The food was good. There was a lot of variety especially at the breakfast and dinner buffets. There were Italian and Chinese restaurants as well as a bar. The Italian restaurant was average. There was also a bakery shop called Biscotti and a lounge restaurant at the Hotel.   Service: The service at the hotel was excellent. The concierges at the check in desks were very helpful. At the concierge desk a taxi can be called for and you can get a sim card from there too which was very helpful for us, but if you want a sim card with data it is not worth it as…"
"Lemon Tree Hotel, Chennai",Zestful Stay,4,"The Chennai property is in keeping with the consistency and ambience which has become the hallmark of the Lemon Tree group.

As a Platinum member the upgrade to the fourth floor was welcome.The room was large and spacious with a pleasant view and tastefully decorated and equipped.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Self Catering Apartments,4,"I stayed at the hotel for 2.5 months, from the beginning of August until mid October. My booking was for a self catering apartment within the hotel grounds. I must say that I was surprised a hotel like this offered such an option. It was ideal for me as a single traveller as it allowed me to enjoy the usual amenities you would expect from a hotel whilst giving me the flexibility to cook my own meals in the comfort of my apartment.  Room Initially I was given a room on level 42 but as the hotel is on the flight path I struggled to sleep and also the balcony of the room opened up to a dumping ground. After complaining I was moved to level 46 with a pool facing room. The gym was around the corner and was at pool level which was great. A shame they didn't offer this to start with.…"

There is a good gym available 24x7 usage, which again I didnt try. The restaurant is quite well made, with a good choice of tasty food for breakfast. The room was quite big and very clean.  I liked the modern & abstracts hung on the wall, giving the overall property a trendy look.  At many places you will find funny quotes and articles.  The bathroom was just apt, with basic essentials.  Free wifi is offered only for 1 hour, which they have put a justification paper at reception (pay as you use)!  Overall I liked the property.…"

Hilton Chennai,Good stay in an international style hotel ,4,Nice stay in this hotel mid December . Efficient hotel pick up ( 15' away without traffic congestion) and welcoming check in despite very much late arrival.  The room is having all what you would expect for this range of hotel . The styling of the whole room is modern but without any specific touch of India . The restaurant is offering a wide diversity of food from Indian to other origins.  The gym is to my point of view not that large and quickly booked when 4 or 5 people are in .  I did not had time to enjoy the roof top pool .... probably next time . …

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Magnificent Crypt for Wealthy Vampires,4,"Okay, what do I mean by this?  The Grand Chola is indeed an enormous, beautiful, ultra-modern, luxury hotel.  But it felt huge and cold and excessively formal to me.  At every step employees tripped over themselves to help me do whatever they thought I needed to do.  Polite, often helpful ... but too much.  The rooms are amazingly beautiful and high tech with a real live iPad controlling everything from the TV to lights and ordering room service.  You even use the iPad to view a door camera and OPEN the door for the room service waiter.  There are fancy restaurants and the food is excellent.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",Excellent hotel with one weak spot,4,"In general was a fantastic hotel -- the pool area was one of the nicest I've experienced in Indian hotels.  I had a Towers Room (entry-level) and it was excellent -- the I-Pad controls for the room worked well.  We worked through the weekend, so we used several of the restaurants, all were very good - good service and good food.  The hotel is large with an incredible amount of Marble, and the staff is keeping it in first class shape.   The only issue I had was with the front desk staff -- they seemed like they were trained and managed by a different team.  My check-in was with a poorly trained associate, who I happened to catch the next morning and he was unable to even comprehend how he would find the conference room that my assistant had reserved, he didn't know and didn't see…"

Hilton Chennai,Experienced the flavour of Hilton Chennai,4,"My wife and I stayed for 6 nights at the Hilton Chennai whilst having medical check ups at the MIOT Hospital which was conveniently 15 minutes away by car. I have stayed in 5 different Hilton hotels around the world & this one was amongst the best. The worst was Hilton Dubai. The strength of Hilton Chennai is through its staff. They were very warm, welcoming, humble and professional. Mr. Vinayak received us on arrival and also saw us off on departure. He was very friendly and made us felt as if we had known him for many years. There should however be more attention to the hotel maintenance with particular attention to the external walls of the building & roof top bar. This is important to maintain the 5-star status of the establishment. Mrs Divya Raheja the Assistant…"
Hilton Chennai,Great Hotel but a bit isolated,4,"Always a warm welcome here a stylish hotel with an impressive lobby and great rooms. Was upgraded to a junior suite as well - very nice. Only down side is it is in the middle of nowhere you have to get a Taxi to go anywhere. While in town take a cab to the beach, and wander around the side streets there for an authentic taste of India. Don't be afraid to try one of the restaurants also - many look like bare halls but they will server you a variety of curries served on a banana leaf, delicious dosas and other tasty morsels and you will struggle to pay more than $5 for a feast. Get used to eating with your hands - no utensils provided ! You will be astonished at the prices as well - my rate was under $100 per night with Breakfast…"

In the last 10 days, we have received note worthy assistance from Samir Jilani (GM), Brinda Das & Bela Babhoota (Guest Services) as the leaders of the organization. Others who deserve our thanks and praise are Rafiq (bellman). Prakash and Raja (breakfast room) and Bhanu (housekeeping). These hands on workers are very sincere and authentic.

What the hotel excelled in was how to make things right. The involvement of the hotel GM and, in particular, Front Office Manager, Aakanksha, displayed how much the hotel values customer feedback.

Hilton Chennai,Brilliant new opening - but give it a while....,5,"I usually stay at the Meridien or Radisson (with weekends at Fishcove), but this beats the first two when in town. It's not that much further from the airport and isn't old (like the Meridien) or a cheap Refurb (like the Radisson) Only been open a couple of weeks so you might want to leave it until end Summer - if you want a Pool that's open, more than 1 place to eat or even a Beer ! (License is still pending).  Despite that, staff are fantastic, rooms bang up to date, design throughout really cool, and the food is excellent.. The bars look like they'll be brilliant (when they have something to serve) and the only downside I can see is that the Gym (which is one of the things actually finished/open) is a bit small - but at least the kit is high quality.  I'll be back soon (next…"

GreenPark Chennai,Value for Money,5,"With so many frequent business trips to Chennai, Green Park has become a second home for me in Chennai. But one thing that Green Park requires is some kind of loyalty program or express check-in for frequent guests. Every time, I have to get my picture clicked and every time all the check-in formalities are conducted. But apart from this Green Park is an excellent value for money for business travelers. Complimentary Wi-Fi service is appreciated too. The restaurant “Once Upon a time” is a must try for everyone. Avoid taking rooms on the construction site, if you are staying for long. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any business traveler.…"

Particularly happy about having entrusted Habeeb from the Concierge desk with a personal overnight sidetrip to Puducherry, with all the attractions on the way. Habeeb was very up front with what's worth seeing & the expected cost, and explained options outside the hotel to lower expenses.

I've stayed at literally hundreds of hotels around the world and The Taj Club House in Chennai probably has the most courteous and well trained staff I've ever come across.  Nothing was too much trouble for any member of the hotel and the common comment, of both myself and my five colleagues, was that we felt like we returning home after each days work.  The rooms were always spotlessly maintained, breakfast each morning was excellent (and a good assortment of local Indian dishes as well as the usual western fare) and our dealings with the front desk and guest relations officer were always warm and helpful.  In fact, the whole experience was so positive that very small problems were…"

Hilton Chennai,Excellent quality and service,5,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels around the world and this one is up there with the best. Food is excellent and varied in the different restaurants, rooms are spacious and well equipped, pool and leisure facilities are excellent and the staff can't do enough for you without being intrusive.  There may be other hotels of this standard in Chennai but I would certainly recommend this one to friends and colleagues and certainly stay again on a business trip or for leisure.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Wonderful property,5,"Rooms and public areas are very spacious, which adds a generally serene feel. Staff is extremely flexible and accommodating, always going the extra mile. It makes a real difference. Food is also excellent, especially the Chinese restaurant and Sunday brunch. Pool very nice. Only slight complaint: wish the management didn't rent poolside out for parties so much as the setup starts in the afternoon and can get a bit noisy (if you're trying to relax in the pool). Management should consider the needs of their regular guests, not just paying outsiders. But overall, a wonderful hotel--Chennai has been flooded with new entrants recently, and this surely ranks as one of the best. Great location, too.…"
Hilton Chennai,Business trip to Chennai,5,"Guest October 12-17, 2014.  The Hilton Chennai is a superior business hotel, within a short drive of the airport.  There are several more opulent hotels in Chennai, but opulence comes at a price and I frankly do not gain much on my trips by having grand marble staircases in the lobby.  The public areas have been of high enough standards to meet with approval from the medical professionals I visit.  Everything has always gone smoothly for my stays at the Hilton Chennai.  Check-in, room quality, food quality, transfers (at all the strange hours you arrive in Chennai), laundry, staff, concierge and atmosphere all allowed me to rest and prepare for business.  If you are traveling on business and want to feel well taken care of in a very comfortable style, the Hilton Chennai is to be…"

(1) This 03 story 5-star property is located near to Chennai Airport. Probably, its proximity to the airport have limited the height of the Hotel. Google map indicates that this hotel is located almost opposite to the north end of the runway, across the Chennai-Trichy highway, which is the only object you see between the airport & the hotel.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Excellent location,5,"The free, personal airport shuttle is one of the best features of the Chennai Radison and the fact that the hotel is located 5 - 10 minutes from the airport, depending on traffic. We were also delighted to see a Radisson representative meet us directly in the airport at baggage claim.  Check-in was a little strenuous due to the hotel's high standards of security (they take a photo of each guest upon arrival...) but the entire staff is extremely helpful and courteous. A receptionist personally accompanied us to the room(s) and explained the features of the hotel: these are normally the markings found occasionally only in 5-star properties.

Right next to the Forum mall that gave me an opportunity to roam around a bit.  Food: Had a light dinner and breakfast at the hotel. The food was of high quality and well prepared.

What's best in Taj Club House in my opinion it would be the service, but it is very hard to choose between the good food and the excellent service. One of the favourite things for me and my colleagues was eating out at the rooftop restaurant Kefi. I honestly think this restaurant does the best grilled chicken dishes that I have ever tasted. I would recommend everyone to try Kefi while they are staying in Taj Club House.  If I have to select one negative thing for the stay in Taj Club House, it would be the airconditioning at the Kefi restaurant. Because it's simply too…"

GreenPark Chennai,Superb place to stay at Chennai,5,"I stayed at Green Park in July'15 for a night and it was a very pleasant experience overall.  Room: Large, spacious rooms with adequate seating space for work as well. The mattresses were firm and comfortable. The bathroom also had all the basic stuff including a very modern shower. All in all, everything you need is all there. The only thing that was a bit of a letdown was the TV which was too small given the size of the room. Location: Superb location. Right next to the Forum mall that gave me an opportunity to roam around a bit.  Food: Had a light dinner and breakfast at the hotel. The food was of high quality and well prepared. The breakfast had a great spread and good mix of healthy and non-so-healthy options. :) Other amenities: Well maintained Gym with enough machines.…"

Great location, friendly front office staff, superb restaurants with fabulous food, beautiful room (the less said about the Chennai scene outside, the better), cost swimming pool, efficient staff members in every area - Taj Club House lives up to the Taj label.  One complaint I have is how we were entertained(!!) with constant live news from the anti-government NDTV channel on the massive TV screen in the restaurant while having breakfast every day. It was depressing to watch live streaming of the Kerala flood situation and deaths on a minute-by-minute basis while eating. There was no way to escape from it as the screen was so large. It was the same channel every single day and there was no attempt to show the news from any of the other English…"

Hilton Chennai,A Royal place to stay at an affordable price,5,"I had an opportunity to stay at the Hilton Chennai hotel during my short stay at Chennai, India.  I called the reservations at 11 pm and within few minutes my reservation was taken care by the Duty Manager.  When I arrived at the hotel 45 minutes later, I was greeted and taken care personally by the same duty Manager.  The lobby is awesome with liveliness at the odd hours of 12:00 am.  Breakfast was a feast of its own.  Lunch was bit disappointment to me as most of my favorite vegetarian items were not listed at all and to add spice to that, there are numerous non-veg items in the list.  Internet speed is much more faster than my house in US.  Pool is awesome at the roof top and the gym is a class of its own.  Executive lounge is perfect for a business trip or for a quite…"

Chef Nisi Kant and his team produce fantastic food, all home cooked, the Indus dahl is superb. Don't bother with a menu, tell chef Nisi Kant what you like and he will create a dish for you, and is more than willing to tell you how he makes everything. I am looking forward to visiting again in the next couple of weeks.…"

I called the hotel for making the booking, however, the reservation person told me to make the booking on their website by which I could get a Club room upgrade. So, I made the booking accordingly. Reached the hotel around 7 pm and was taken to the Club Floor reception on the third floor. I was given a room in 34th floor ( only named like this and not that tall!). The room was quite big with a huge bed, side sofa, and the sitting sofa along the bed with chairs,  which was the perfect place to watch the World Cup going on at that time.

Radisson Blu Hotel GRT Chennai,Great Hotel with Excellent Staff,5,We chose to stay overnight in this hotel when chennai was recovering from the unprecedented  floods in December. We were assisted at the front desk by Mr Jay who organised a Room for us at very short notice. The check in process was swift and efficient.

The hotel also has a number of excellent dinning options. The only small hitch i have constantly noticed is their check in process.

All centrally controlled via an IPad. You can control the entertainment, the TV, the internet as well as the door.  The best part of the experience though is the food. The pinnacle of which is - Peshawari, the North West Frontier restaurant at the Lobby level. The delicious kebabs, the rumali rotis, the calming buttermilk all created an authentic taste. The service as expected, was friendly and helpful.  Don't forget to book a table with the captain. Even on a weekday, it's quite popular.  All…"

They have mood lighting and all services aligned via an iPAD within your room, and the service is impeccable.  The hotel itself is amazing, large, and has several accommodations: five star restaurants, several recommendations on things to do in the area (I love their concierge), and overall, it truly doesn't feel as if you're staying at a hotel. I felt so at home; I've been here for almost 15 days and don't want to leave!  I highly recommend it.

I hesitate to use the work ""Staff"" as I view the fantastic employees at the Taj Clubhouse more as friends rather than staff. This is one of these hotels you come across while travelling where it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes it special - there's just something about it.

The customer service is the same world class that we have been used to in ITC properties. The breakfast buffet is awesome with a wide array of choices. The hotel also has a number of excellent dinning options. The only small hitch i have constantly noticed is their check in process. This time I checked in by 6pm but they still needed a few minutes to get the room ready. To their credit they did write to asking for my check in time but I did not respond to that note. Otherwise a great stay and I will be back soon.…

I have stayed in some of the biggest names in the hospitality industry but I guess this hotel can teach them a thing or two about it. Simple things which I am sure doesnt cost the hotel much, but are greatly helpful to the guests are their freebies. Now I dont want to sound cheap, but they were of great help.

They are marvelous and amazingly resourceful. ITC Grand Chola is like a fairytale come true.…"
Taj Club House,Comfortable and friendly!,5,"The Hotel is centrally located, close to the shopping areas. The rooms are spacious but do not offer any special view. Got a free upgrade to a Suite!

IPad room controls were convenient from the bed.  The bathroom was grand.  Housekeeping service was good.  Breakfast in the Madras Pavilion was great - fruit was fresh, idlies were soft & chutneys were thick, filter coffee on the weekends came with a flourish (a two-foot pour!), and was just as good during the week.  There were also veg & non veg dumplings, porridge, omelettes & sausage, bread & cheese, dosas, lassis, oh too many choices to list, on offer.  We enjoyed breakfast every day for a…"

The stay here has been truly amazing, exceeding my expectations in every way possible.

Obuli made sure the chef had some plain foods, made sure I had plenty of tea and regularly checked on me. This was above and beyond anything I could have asked for. Being alone and sick in a different country can be scary, but Obuli made all my worries go away.  As for my room, the housekeeping team is THE BEST!

Hyatt Regency Chennai,GOOD hotel but it's the staff that make it EXCELLENT,5,"I stayed in this hotel for around 8 nights and enjoyed every single night of it. The staff made me feel very welcome and they were very accommodating. Especially worth calling out the friendly, smiling ladies who received me every morning for breakfast and Vignish who was extremely attentive during breakfast.  Something which completely impressed me was the Housekeeping Manager's attention to detail (I believe his name is Karthik V). I asked him the night before where I could buy some fresh fruit and nuts so I could have a healthy snack in my room in the evening. He gave me friendly advise on where to shop, but because my work schedule was very busy I never had time to go.   The next day I arrived at my hotel after a long day at work and found a bowl with beautifully presented…"

They have mood lighting and all services aligned via an iPAD within your room, and the service is impeccable.  The hotel itself is amazing, large, and has several accommodations: five star restaurants, several recommendations on things to do in the area (I love their concierge), and overall, it truly doesn't feel as if you're staying at a hotel. I felt so at home; I've been here for almost 15 days and don't want to leave!  I highly recommend it.

The rooms were spotless, spacious and palatial.  The attention to detail, meticulous.   We got The Deccan Herald each morning, but after i mentioned that i preferred ""The Hindu"" newspaper, it was seamlessly delivered each morning of our stay.   The fruit basket was silently replenished, always with something a little different, like fresh, delicious Asian pears.

It’s a very complex hotel so finding your room and the special regions of the hotel can be a challenge. We have a wide Friday of high-quality restaurants. Hotels a little bit beat up in terms of maintaining carpets wall condition paint etc. Room service was marginal some days getting full service and other days getting partial service although it may be because we were there over republic day. There’s no Store in the hotels to make sure you bring all of your goods. This includes no way to buy alcohol and expensively in the hotel and the stock refrigerators or alcohol free.

I had requested for a suite upgrade as part of my SPG platinum privileges. What I actually ended up with was way beyond my expectations. Due to a dearth of available suites, I was instead upgraded to a 2-bedroom 1200 sq ft residence which was out of this world. Must specially mention ""Brinda Das"" - who heads the customer relations - and who went out of her way to ensure that my family - including my kids - were well looked after.

The whole experience was excellent, from the car collecting me from the airport, the staff at the door, and the reception staff. Breakfast is highly recommended, there is a huge choice and again the staff cannot do enough to help or make suggestions for you. You must visit the in house 'Beyond Indus' Indian restaurant. Chef Nisi Kant and his team produce fantastic food, all home cooked, the Indus dahl is superb. Don't bother with a menu, tell chef Nisi Kant what you like and he will create a dish for you, and is more than willing to tell you how he makes everything. I am looking forward to visiting again in the next couple of weeks.…"

The piece-de-resistance was the superb morning breakfast served in the ITC Grand Chola.  The staff took particular care and showed eye for detail and attention in recommending their finest dishes based on my preferences. Even ordinary dishes such as the unassuming South Indian Idly was beautifully and tastefully cooked with some special touch by the chef.  The Pongal was mouth wateringly good and so were the other dishes. The filter coffee was par excellence. …

She also helped us choose which restaurant to have dinner at, giving us a glimpse of the several choices available. We had dinner at the Peshawari restaurant.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",An amazing hotel!,5,"This is my second stay in an ITC Grand Hotel - the first last November in Mumbai. This visit exceeded the one in Mumbai! It is an exceptional hotel - yes, expensive, but worth it. The memorable things include the sensational buffet breakfast, the beautiful rooms, and being on the floor that included the exercise room and a 25m swimming pool. Since our conference was here, we didn't leave the hotel (having been in India a number of times before).  Although the staff is nice, i have to say the staff in Mumbai was more friendly except one here in particular - Varalika - who was so much fun to interact with my wife and me at breakfast.  We also had good food at the bars, except they were overpriced, i think - a lessor expensive glass of wine for 900 rupees!…"

Hilton Chennai,I would give 10 stars if it is allowed in TripAdvisor,5,"This is simply the best Hilton I have ever stayed. The differentiating factor is not the room and facility but the service from every single staff I interacted, from concierge, front desk, to restaurant staff and drivers. They really ""put personal interest"" into service, and really made my two stays feeling like home in my first trip to India last week.

Great location, friendly front office staff, superb restaurants with fabulous food, beautiful room (the less said about the Chennai scene outside, the better), cost swimming pool, efficient staff members in every area - Taj Club House lives up to the Taj label.  One complaint I have is how we were entertained(!!) with constant live news from the anti-government NDTV channel on the massive TV screen in the restaurant while having breakfast every day. It was depressing to watch live streaming of the Kerala flood situation and deaths on a minute-by-minute basis while eating. There was no way to escape from it as the screen was so large. It was the same channel every single day and there was no attempt to show the news from any of the other English…"

On the first part of the stay the check-in was processed efficiently as we were enjoying a welcome drink. Room was absolutely top notch. Had the buffet breakfast next day, it was fantastic, especially the Indian choices.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Glittering and Comfortable Hotel,5,"I stayed at this recently-opened hotel in early Feb 2012.  This is a very classy modern-style hotel in a good area of Chennai. The rooms are quite large compared to most other 5 star hotels in Chennai.  Polished marble floors in the rooms and minimal cloth draperies help keep any mildew odor problems away.  Very confortable bedding, huge shower, spacious worktable with plentiful universal electrical receptacles make living and working in the rooms easy. The rooms may feel even larger due to the unique moving walls/doors between the bath area and the room.  That might make sharing the room with someone other than a spouse slightly more challenging though, but a motorized privacy screen makes this easier.  on the pass-thru vanity.

Hilton Chennai,Excellent Hotel at Excellent Location,5,"We always prefer staying closer to the airport (Trident, Raddisson) but this time we decided to check out Hilton since the hotel has come to the city recently. We should say we did make the right decision to check it out. I think we might look at staying in Hilton again (not very far from the airport).  We arrived by road from Trichy, we were well received with a complimentary drink, cold towels and chocolates and a teddy for our little daughter. The front desk was quite methodical (and a bit slow) in checking us in but no complaints since we were well taken care of!  The room itself was very nice, beautiful decor and ambience. We were given a room on the 6th floor which kinda smelt funny (that smell was not there in other floors).  Otherwise room size was good, ample facilities…"

Locals tell me that Peshawri and Royal Vega are both highly regarded by them.  The curtains are pitch dark - something very welcome to international travelers. I had a minor issue with the shower draining slowly that I passed along to a staffer in the hallway.  That night upon my return he made a point to tell me they'd corrected it. And the digivalet iPad-controlled features are sweet.  Wifi tested out 3 Mbps up and down, both wired and wifi, using the lower-priced internet plan (no free wifi here).…"

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",True to its name...,5,"True to its name the style and architecture is very similar to the Chola dynasty style and just like a palace with 600 rooms.  check in-staff were very polite and helpful and the process was quick with no hassles. Room - I got a room on 24th level and even though the outside resembles like a palace the room has been designed to keep taste with current style. Rooms are sound proof.Queen size bed, very comfortable, pillows were good to get a good sleep. Lights, AC, door room service all at the tip of fingers using their ipad which was helpful when you hit the bed after a long day.

"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Fabulous hotel, food and service",5,"I've stayed twice at this hotel now, first in November 2017 and again in April 2018.  I've been meaning to write a review ever since....  This hotel is so impressive from the moment you arrive.  The staff are friendly, curteous and extremely helpful.  The rooms are spotless and very well equipped (last time I was upgraded to a two bedroom suite, which was amazing).  The public areas are stylish and well equipped, with plenty of seating and a comfortable level of lighting.  There is even an amazing smell of fresh flowers all over the hotel, which I'm sure doesn't come from the many flower displays, which are, in themselves tremendous.  There is a great choice of restaurants - my favourite was the Italian, to be honest.  Breakfast in the main dining room is a lavish affair with…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel","Very comfortable, with excellent staff",5,"I've stayed at the ITC Chola a couple of times now, and it's a really comfortable hotel.  The building itself is very impressive, and that continues inside.  The communal areas, bars and restaurants of the hotel are very well thought out, and the food and drink is good (a little on the expensive side, but to be expected for this type of hotel).  The attention to detail around the hotel is brilliant, with the staff always being very helpful.    Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed, can't fault them.  The only slight downside (if it counts as one) is that the hotel always seems very quiet. I suspect that this is partly a product of the sheer scale of the hotel, but it does mean that it can lack a little atmosphere.  That said, it would still be my first choice of hotel…"

The location is good too as it is in walking distance from the shopping mall Spencer where you can get lot of souvenirs.   The cons are humidity in rooms and quite thin walls. Waiters in the restaurant can be slow too, especially at 4 am :-)…"

The staff is just too courteous,sometimes maybe a bit too much. The food is excellent. I could only try the Peshawari restaurant and we went there only for its renowned 'Dal Bukhara' which is exceptional of course. The rooms are nasty big with all the luxury you could possibly imagine from huge bathrooms to ordering your own pillows. The Malt and Cigar lounge is just fantastic.

The swiftness and keenness to help and service the guests seems to come naturally to the staff.

The powder room is spacious.  Everything in this hotel is larger than life... right from the floor lobby to the lifts to the restaurants. The lobby is humongous and you cannot go without clicking some pictures.  The staff right from the gatekeepers to the receptionists to the butlers are all courteous and warm.

The choice of restaurants were great, and ranged from traditional food, to Japanese, Italian and Chinese, not forgetting to mention there was bar food if you wanted a snack.

The lounge areas are comfy and welcoming so our wait was done in comfort. The rooms are clean and well cared for, with extras such as wash kits and hairdryers.

This hotel recognized we were had an extended stay and made our experience exception.  Two extraordinary features of the hotel: breakfast at the Madras Pavillion (included with many rooms and for Spg platinum members), best breakfast anywhere, and the Kaya Kulp spa which has an incredible deal if you get 10 hours or more of services.  This hotel has many of the best restaurants in Chennai.  We went one day for cooking classes at Storytrails and there were a few wives of expats there who lived in Chennai for over two years. Their favorite eating establishments were Peshawri and Pan Asian in the city.  Peshawri is amazing especially when you sample multiple items on the menu.  My wife is a foody and extreme…"
"ITC Grand Chola, Chennai - a Luxury Collection Hotel",An amazing hotel!,5,"This is my second stay in an ITC Grand Hotel - the first last November in Mumbai. This visit exceeded the one in Mumbai! It is an exceptional hotel - yes, expensive, but worth it. The memorable things include the sensational buffet breakfast, the beautiful rooms, and being on the floor that included the exercise room and a 25m swimming pool. Since our conference was here, we didn't leave the hotel (having been in India a number of times before).  Although the staff is nice, i have to say the staff in Mumbai was more friendly except one here in particular - Varalika - who was so much fun to interact with my wife and me at breakfast.  We also had good food at the bars, except they were overpriced, i think - a lessor expensive glass of wine for 900 rupees!…"

The Park Chennai,Funky and with the right frills,5,"You step into the hotel and are almost amused at its kitsch-ness. it has the right balance of funk, elegance and some inventive decor which somehow makes it all work well. I This funk-elegance factors in everywhere - decor, menu;s, staff uniforms and attitude.  The rooms are quite fun, with filmy posters mostly of pretty forgettable films which adds to the quirkiness. they are generally smallish sized rooms though which is ok if you are travelling alone on work.  Their acqua restaurant (roof top and pool side) is beautiful if the weather is cool. i would recomend it for a romantic chilled out evening. Their coffee shop, 601, has to be the best coffee shop in the country. superb food, options and menus. Nightclub pasha is quite small and can be cramped esp on weekends. The…"

Good working desk, International outlets, so I could plug in my US plugs without problems. The same size observation goes for the hotel actually; it is very, very large (which was why we were there in the first place, for a conference with >1,000 participants, which the hotel handled seamlessly).  Good features include the residents lounge as a place to unwind and enjoy a coffee (morning) or a drink with some snacks (later in the day), two bars (of which one has a cigar selection and smoking room), and a variety of restaurants,…"

The staff were superb - very courteous and service oriented in every aspect of the hotel - a special mention goes to Christley at the Café Marcara whose customer service and general hospitality was second to none. my room was a Queen category and was very comfortable - all electrical items could be controlled from an iPad type gadget which sat beside the bed - the ultimate in being lazy but after a hard day in the city perhaps this is what you need. Every facility in the hotel was in super order and cleanliness and if you're old school and want to relax with a nice Cigar then you could wander along to the Cigar lounge - perfect.

I met the PR Manager Darshini there who told me that the musician was from AR Rahman's music school in Chennai. I had a cosmo drink which they made and serve to be at my table! quite interesting indeed. They have some great cocktails too -  I told the bar tender who was a girl that i loved lemongrass and she made me this absolutely amazing cocktail!

Taj Club House,Best service in town,5,"I had my second visit at the Taj Club House and I glad to see that things haven't changed. The service is still best in town. Staff is very helpfull and welcoming. They always make you feel like your coming home. What's best in Taj Club House in my opinion it would be the service, but it is very hard to choose between the good food and the excellent service. One of the favourite things for me and my colleagues was eating out at the rooftop restaurant Kefi. I honestly think this restaurant does the best grilled chicken dishes that I have ever tasted. I would recommend everyone to try Kefi while they are staying in Taj Club House.  If I have to select one negative thing for the stay in Taj Club House, it would be the airconditioning at the Kefi restaurant. Because it's simply too…"

While they had to make choices to conserve food and fuel and assure that everyone was taken care of, they made sure we were safe, dry and fed. Outside of the flood, the rooms were magnificent. Huge bathrooms, excellent toiletries, clean beyond reproach. The a/c worked flawlessly, there was always plentiful supplies (water, tea, coffee) and the WiFi excellent throughout the building. The food in the restaurants was tasty and well prepared, though as noted the choices became somewhat limited due to the total shutdown of the city.

This is one of these hotels you come across while travelling where it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes it special - there's just something about it.

Taj Club House,Nothing to complaint about - The Taj experience,5,"Stayed at the hotel for two quick visits in consequtive weeks & there is absolutely nothing to complaint about.

The base room (I was sure I was not getting a suite against a free voucher LOL) was spectacular.  Luxury to its best.  The best part was that the room had an iPad that allowed me to control the lights, AC, open the door, order room service and even had over a 1000 newspapers.  This was a first and very innovative.

Complimentary Wi-Fi service is appreciated too. The restaurant “Once Upon a time” is a must try for everyone. Avoid taking rooms on the construction site, if you are staying for long.

This is my first trip traveling internationally, and I have been blown away by the service, professionalism and hospitality here at the Hilton.  Yes it is a Hilton, and it is a very nice place to stay and enjoy the amenities, but it is the staff that works so hard here that puts this hotel, a head above the rest.  Vasco’s Managers - Srikanth J and Mayank Bajpai, Executive Lounge bartenders - Siva and Basistha, Concierge- Aathil Alaudeen, and probably one of the best waiters I have ever meet, Siva Vel, along with the dozens of other people who work at the hotel, who made me feel so welcome and so at home.

My best experience in this hotel was the food; ‘Beyond Indus’ offered the finest Indian cuisine, produced by Chef Nisi Kant Panigrahi. This man was a real genius preparing the tastiest dishes that could meet anyone’s requirements.

Hyatt Regency Chennai,Beautiful hotel,5,I was in Chennai for about 5 days in October 2015. We arrived very early in the morning and the hotel staff was very helpful. I had three rooms booked for our group and they upgraded two of our rooms. The upgrades were amazing. We paid the extra money for the breakfast and internet on the rooms. You cannot beat the breakfast at the restaurant. If they give you a 5000 INR option per night to get internet and breakfast be sure you get it. The hotel front desk helped us get a taxi and was able to tell us how to get to a local mall so we could bring stuff home back to the USA. If you are looking for a top notch hotel in Chennai this is your place to stay.…
